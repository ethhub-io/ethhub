# Gitcoin Grants

Fast, easy, and secure way to provide recurring token contributions to the best OSS maintainers in your community. Your contribution is amplified by the signal it provides to other (potentially, larger) funders on important infrastructure projects.

Grants utilizes the EIP-1337 standard for subscriptions on Ethereum. The standard makes use of meta-transactions, which allows for a transaction to be made on behalf of a paying subscriber on a recurring basis. This makes it easy to support projects in open source on a recurring basis, only confirming one initial subscription transaction.

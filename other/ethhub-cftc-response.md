# EthHub CFTC Response

On December 11th, 2018 the CFTC [submitted a public "Requst for Input"](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/federalregister121118.pdf) which asks for clarity and answers around Ethereum. The following is a list of all questions asked in the RFI. The following answers were developed on EthHub, an open source, community run information hub for the Ethereum community.

_**From the CFTC: In providing your responses, please be as specific as possible, and offer concrete examples where appropriate. Please provide any relevant data to support your answers where appropriate. The Commission encourages all relevant comments on related items or issues; commenters need not address every question.**_

Answer: 

#### 3. How is the developer community currently utilizing the Ethereum Network? More specifically, what are prominent use cases or examples that demonstrate the functionalities and capabilities of the Ethereum Network?

Answer: 

#### 4. Are there any existing or developing commercial enterprises that are using Ether to power economic transactions? If so, how is Ether recorded for accounting purposes in a comprehensive set of financial statements?

Answer: 

#### 5. What data sources, analyses, calculations, variables, or other factors could be used to determine Ether’s market size, liquidity, trade volume, types of traders, ownership concentration, and/or principal ways in which the Ethereum Network is currently being used by market participants?

Answer: 

#### 6. How many confirmations on the Ethereum blockchain are sufficient to wait to ensure that the transaction will not end up on an invalid block?

Answer: 

## Technology

#### 7. How is the technology underlying Ethereum similar to and different from the technology underlying Bitcoin?

Answer: 

#### 8. Does the Ethereum Network face scalability challenges? If so, please describe such challenges and any potential solutions. What analyses or data sources could be used to assess concerns regarding the scalability of the underlying Ethereum Network, and in particular, concerns about the network’s ability to support the growth and adoption of additional smart contracts?

Answer: 

#### 9. Has a proof of stake consensus mechanism been tested or validated at scale? If so, what lessons or insights can be learned from the experience?

Answer: 

#### 10. Relative to a proof of work consensus mechanism does proof of stake have particular vulnerabilities, challenges, or features that make it prone to manipulation? In responding consider, for example, that under a proof of stake consensus mechanism, the chance of validating a block may be proportional to staked wealth.

Answer: 

#### 11. There are reports of disagreements within the Ether community over the proposed transition to a proof of stake consensus model. Could this transition from a proof of work to a proof of stake verification process result in a fragmented or diminished Ether market if the disagreements are not resolved?

Answer: 

#### 12. What capability does the Ethereum Network have to support the continued development and increasing use of smart contracts?

Answer: 

## Governance

#### 13. How is the governance of the Ethereum Network similar to and different from the governance of the Bitcoin network?

Answer: 

#### 14. In light of Ether’s origins as an outgrowth from the Ethereum Classic blockchain, are there potential issues that could make Ether’s underlying blockchain vulnerable to future hard forks or splintering?

Answer: 

## Markets, Oversight and Regulation

#### 15. Are there protections or impediments that would prevent market participants or other actors from intentionally disrupting the normal function of the Ethereum Network in an attempt to distort or disrupt the Ether market?

Answer: 

#### 16. What impediments or risks exist to the reliable conversion of Ether to legal tender? How do these impediments or risks impact regulatory considerations for Commission registrants with respect to participating in any transactions in Ether, including the ability to obtain or demonstrate possession or control or otherwise hold Ether as collateral or on behalf of customers?

Answer: 

#### 17. How would the introduction of derivative contracts on Ether potentially change or modify the incentive structures that underlie a proof of stake consensus model?

Answer: 

#### 21. What other factors could impact the Commission’s ability to properly oversee or monitor trading in derivative contracts on Ether as well as the underlying Ether cash markets?

Answer: 

#### 22. Are there any emerging best practices for monitoring the Ethereum Network and public blockchains more broadly?

Answer: 

## Cyber Security and Custody

#### 23. Are there security issues peculiar to the Ethereum Network or Ethereum- supported smart contracts that need to be addressed?

Answer: 

#### 24. Are there any best practices for the construction and security of Ethereum wallets, including, but not limited to, the number of keys required to sign a transaction and how access to the keys should be segregated?

Answer: 

#### 25. Are there any best practices for conducting an independent audit of Ether deposits?

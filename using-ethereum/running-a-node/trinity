# Trinity & Py-EVM

Py-EVM is a new implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) written in Python. Trinity is the client software that connects to the Ethereum network and runs on top of Py-EVM. It is currently in active development but is quickly progressing through the test suite provided by ethereum/tests. 
Trinity and Py-EVM aim to replace existing Python Ethereum implementations to eventually become the defacto standard for the Python ecosystem.

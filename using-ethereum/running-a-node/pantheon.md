# Pantheon

Pantheon is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Apache 2.0 license and written in Java. It runs on the Ethereum public network, private networks, and test networks such as Rinkeby and Ropsten. Pantheon implements Proof of Work \(Ethash\) and Proof of Authority \(Clique\) consensus mechanisms.

You can use Pantheon to develop enterprise applications requiring secure, high-performance transaction processing in a private network.

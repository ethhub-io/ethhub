# Desktop

## What are they?

Desktop wallets are downloadable apps capable of operating on Windows, MacOS, or Linux that allow users to interact with their funds.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

* If you're able to create/sign transactions offline, this is the most-secure method for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
* Non-custodial, and more private than most other methods of interacting with your funds.

### Cons

* May be more of a hassle when used offline than other methods of accessing your funds.

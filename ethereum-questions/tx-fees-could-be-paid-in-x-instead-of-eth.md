# Is it true users will pay fees in other tokens and Ether will have no value?

This is false as explained by EthHub founder, Eric Conner on Twitter:

"To pay for a tx in something other than ETH:

1. Open communication with a miner 
2. Manually calc the cost of the tx in that tokens value
3. Send miner payment & wait for confirm
4. Execute initial TX and get the nonce
5. Tell the miner the nonce and wait for his next block

On top of the added friction to users mentioned above, there is an added cost to users to pay for their transaction in something other than ETH. Sending ETH in a transaction costs 21000 gas while sending tokens costs 40000 gas or more. No one likes extra tax"

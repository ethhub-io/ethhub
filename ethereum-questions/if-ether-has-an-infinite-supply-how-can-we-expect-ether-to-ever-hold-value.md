# If Ether has an infinite supply how can we expect Ether to ever hold value?

The rate at which Ether is issued lowers over time. The idea is that eventually the rate of issuance will be lower than the rate of Ether being locked into staking, deposited into smart contracts, and lost in transactions and wallets, causing Ether to actually become a deflationary currency.

# Proof of Location

## Summary
The Ethereum network can support smart applications that will allow for a verifiable and consensus-driven replacement for GPS. Smart contracts that require location-based services will require trustless sources for geospatial information.

### How will it work
There will likely be several geospatial protocols that use a combination of methods such as radio mesh networks, satellites, and  IOT hardware.

### Problem with GPS
"Civil GPS is unencrypted, it has no proof-of-origin or authentication features, and despite dire
warnings first raised in 2012, the system remains extremely susceptible to fraud, spoofing,
jamming, and cyberattack" - FOAM Protocol

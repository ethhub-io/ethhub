# History

## Initial Concept

Vitalik Buterin first described the concept of Ethereum through the [White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper). The vision was to put a generic [turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) scripting language on top of a blockchain.

The concept was [publicly introduced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9dpjN3Mwps&t=1s) by Vitalik at Bitcoin Miami 2014.

## Initial ETH Distribution

The Ethereum presale took place from Tuesday, 22 July 2014 to Tuesday, 2 September 2014, lasting a total of 42 days. The price of ether was initially set to a discounted price of 2000 ETH per BTC, and stayed that way for 14 days before linearly declining to a final rate of 1337 ETH per BTC.

60 Million ether was created for the presale of which 80% was available for purchase with 20% \(or 12 Million\) being retained by the Ethereum Foundations 'development fund' which consisted of early contributors to the project and developers.

The initial supply schedule was 3 ethers created every block \(roughly 15 seconds\) that was rewarded to the miner of the block and 0.625-2.625 ethers were sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but their block wasn't included \(called uncle/aunt reward\). Please refer to the [Monetary Policy](monetary-policy/) page for the current supply schedule.

The presale ended with ~31,000 BTC \(equivalent to ~$18.3 million\) being raised by the Ethereum Foundation over the 42 days.

Ether was not usable or transferable until the launch of the genesis block which occured on July 30th, 2015.

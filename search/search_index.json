Most applications today fall into the following categories. Open Finance Open finance refers to a number of decentralized protocols building open financial infrastructure. These protocols are valuable because they're creating the necessary plumbing to enable anyone in the world with an internet connection to access self-sovereign, censorship resistant financial services. Oracles Oracles refers to a protocols or services to connect Ethereum to offchain information. They can be utilized for querying information from the internet (e.g. API calls), information about other chains (e.g. BTC transactions), or even as dispute resolution mechanisms concerning non-native assets. Decentralized Exchanges Decentralized Exchanges allow for the trading of crypto assets without the need for a trusted central authority. This cuts down on the risk of exchange hacks and many other risks. There are many types of decentralized exchanges and it's important to understand the differences. Gaming Blockchain games are any games that include blockchain technology in its backend or mechanics in general. Collectibles Crypto collectibles are unique items that adhere to the ERC-721 standard. They can be collected and perhaps used across many different games and applications built on Ethereum. Marketplaces Marketplaces built on Ethereum allow for the trading of ERC-721 tokens such as crypto collectibles. Developer Tools A suite of developer tools allow for better standards and easy implementation of these standards across many different applications. Identity Identity is a very important aspect to the future of Ethereum. The Ethereum network hosts many DApps that are building identity systems. These DApps leverage the secure and decentralized nature of the Ethereum network often in collaboration with decentralized storage protocols such as IPFS or SWARM to enable empower and protect consumers' information. Citizens will be able to confidentionally reveal personal information such as Gov. ID, credit score, medical history, banking information, etc. to others in a way that also allows them to revoke future access to such information. Governance Given the decentralized nature of the protocol, it\u2019s important for some applications to have a way to govern their team, project or app. Infrastructure Building out basic infrastructure needs using Ethereum as a base layer. Token Curated Registries Token Curated Registries are registries of listings generated by token holders. Listings can be anything from names to hashes of full-blown records stored in IPFS. ERC Token Standards ERC Token Standards are technical documents used by smart contract developers at Ethereum. They define a set of rules required to implement tokens for the Ethereum ecosystem.","title":"Built on Ethereum"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/built-on-ethereum/#built-on-ethereum","text":"There are many different types of applications that can be built on Ethereum.

This is another tool in Cloudflare\u2019s Distributed Web Gateway tool set. Currently, Cloudflare lets you host content on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and access it through your own custom domain. Similarly, the new Ethereum Gateway allows access to the public Ethereum network, which you can provision through your custom hostname. This setup makes it possible to add interactive elements to sites powered by Ethereum smart contracts, a decentralized computing platform.

However, two-thirds of the population remains unbanked. 70 million Filipinos have severely limited access to both the domestic and global financial ecosystems. This poses a significant problem when up to 10% of the Philippines' GDP is made up of international remittances sent from overseas workers to family members across the country. Solution UnionBank of the Philippines, one of the largest banking institutions in the country, sought to tackle this challenge by partnering with ConsenSys Solutions, Kaleido, Amazon AWS, ConsenSys Diligence, Microsoft Azure, and seven rural Philippine banks to create an inter-rural bank payment platform using Enterprise Ethereum. Project i2i implemented Enterprise Ethereum to create a decentralized, cost-efficient, real-time inter-rural bank payment platform that operates autonomously outside of existing payment infrastructures and intermediaries such as the Philippines' PhilPass and SWIFT. The Project i2i platform works to connect rural banks as well as national commercial banks to the central bank, helping remote banks integrate with the domestic financial system while also improving banking access for local citizens. The commercial launch of the i2i platform is scheduled for 2019, in partnership with 130 rural banks. Project i2i has received clearance and support from the central bank of the Philippines to operate as the country's first Ethereum-based payment network for domestic funds transfers.

SARB created a simulation to assess if the performance, scale, and confidentiality of payments were possible utilizing blockchain technology. Solution In consortium with seven commercial banks, SARB partnered with ConsenSys Solutions and Adhara, to build a proof-of-concept grounded in real-world performance, confidentiality requirements, and diverse bank hardware on the blockchain\u2014without a single point of failure. By harnessing a permissioned blockchain network, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism, Pedersen commitments, and range proofs, Project Khoka was able to replicate interbank clearing and settlements in less than two hours. The project achieved the transaction performance target at 70,000 transactions in less than two hours, privacy while meeting required transaction volumes.

Solution MAS launched a three-phase exercise in partnership with a consortium of international banks, distributed ledger technologies, and blockchain providers. Phase 1 consisted of a research and feasibility study around the potential applications of blockchain technology. The study explored: Benefits and pitfalls of tokenizing central bank currency Optimizing payment settlements between participating local banks Steps to enable cross-border transactions Effective methods of digitizing payments Phase 2 focused on how to use blockchain platforms and tokenization in the daily settlement and clearing process to enable RTGS. During this phase, MAS partnered with ConsenSys Solutions and JP Morgan's Quorum enterprise blockchain platform. Together, they successfully demonstrated how a tokenized Singaporean dollar could function as a means of daily inter-bank settlement.

A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations (for example, semi-fungible tokens). Motivation Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each fungible or NFT token/collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of crypto games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of tokens, and a new type of token standard is needed to support this. New functionality is possible with this design, such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to \"approve\" individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible tokens in a single contract. Batch Transfers The safeBatchTransferFrom function allows for batch transfers of multiple token ids and values. Gas savings improves with the number of token types in the batch transfer, compared to single transfers with multiple transactions. Approval Single-token based approval of specific token values has been dropped in favor of the function setApprovalForAll which allows an operator to manage one's entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver.

While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Each NFT is identified through an uint256 ID. They may be transferred through two different funcions: A safe transfer function safeTansferFrom() which verifies that the msg.sender ,i.e. the user that triggered the function, is the owner of the token or an authorized user allowed to transfer the token. A non-secure trasfer transferFrom() , where there is no preliminary authorization verification. The token developer is responsible for implementing a piece of code in this function that verifies that the responsible for calling the function is authorized to do so. In this function, the user calling it must also verify that the receiver is entitle for receiving the token. If these verifications are not performed, the tokens could be lost forever. ERC721 tokens must implement the proposed ERC165 interface. This standard allows the detection of the interfaces implemented by a contract. This is really useful, as it allows to detect the interface that a token implements and, consequently, adapt the method/code to interact with it. What does \u201cfungible\u201d mean?! If an item is fungible, then it can be substituted or exchanged for any similar item. Fiat currencies, like the US dollar, contain fungible units. One dollar bill can be exchanged for any other dollar bill. Cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MANA are all fungible because one token can be exchanged for any other token. The only thing that changes is a record on the blockchain registering the transaction. It must follow that two non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable. So what is it about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that gives them this quality? The answer lies in the data or information stored within NFTs. We can compare two real-world examples of fungible and non-fungible items that most people should be familiar with: dollars and movie tickets. Dollars These are obviously fungible, if I have a dollar and you have a dollar, we can trade the two and neither of us will be any richer or poorer than we were before.

Each kitty exists on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC721 non-fungible token. Each ERC721 kitty has a unique ID, genes that defines its appearance and rarity, a generation that affects the kitty's rarity, and a cooldown that determines how long the cat must wait before it can breed again. For a small fee, players can breed two kitties together to create a new ERC721 kitty. The new kitten's traits are randomly determined through the combination of the traits of its parents and an on-chain random number oracle, although its generation will always be greater than that of its parents. Generation The game began with the creation of 50,000 Generation 0 kitties. The smart contract does not allow any more Generation 0 kitties to be created beyond 50,000. Whenever two kitties breed, the generation of their offspring is equal to the highest generation of either parent plus one. For example, if two Generation 0 kitties breed, they create a Generation 1 kitty. If a Generation 0 and a Generation 8 kitty breed, they create a Generation 9 kitty. This mechanic of increasing a kitty's generation with each breed preserves the rarity of lower gneeration Cryptokitties, preventing users from flooding the marketplace and destroying the value of all kitties. Genes Each kitty has 48 genes, spanning twelve different gene categories. Within each category, each kitty has a dominant gene, a hidden-1 gene, a hidden-2 gene, and a hidden-3 gene. The dominant genes are the genes that determine a kitty's appearance. When breeding two kitty's together, the offspring is likely to get the dominant gene of either parent for each category, but has a small chance of getting one of the parent's hidden-1 genes, an even smaller chance of getting one of the parent's hidden-2 genes, and a very small chance of getting one of the parent's hidden-3 genes. When two parent's have genes that match up in a certain way, then there is a small chance of that gene \"mewtating\" into a higher-tier gene that neither parent had originally had. The community has created calculators for determining the probabilities of the genes of a given offspring, such as KittyCalc , and the community has created trait charts that demonstrate the mewtation process, which can be found at KittyHelper and at KittyFyi . For a more detailed explanation, see the section labeled Genes under the CryptoKitties Guide below. Cooldown Each cat has a cooldown that determines how long a user must wait before they can breed the cat again. A kitty's initial cooldown is determined by its generation. The higher the generation, the worse the cooldown the kitty is born with. Cooldowns range from 1 minute to 1 week. Each time that a kitty breeds, its cooldown increases, to a maximum of one week. The kitty's offspring will not be born until the cooldown has completed. History Gods Unchained crossover On January 10th, 2019, a partnership between CryptoKitties and the trading card game Gods Unchained was announced . The partnership was significant because it featured extensibility for the first time between two blockchain games. Extensibility is the ability to use an NFT from one game in another game. Between Jan. 10th to Jan. 28th, 2019, Cryptokitties users were able to convert any Cryptokitty into a Gods Unchained statue for a small fee. The Cryptokitty statue is purely used for aesthetic purposes in the Gods Unchained game, allowing a Gods Unchained user to decorate their board while playing a match but having no in-game effect on the game's mechanics. However, each statue's appearance differed depending on the on-chain genes that the Cryptokitty had, meaning that certain kitty's with rarer genes could create rarer statues. This demonstrates how one blockchain game can make use of the information contained within the ERC-721 tokens of another blockchain game, opening up an entire universe of possibilities for interoperability and cross-game collaboration. Noteably, the statue-creation process did not destroy the Cryptokitty that was used, meaning that a user could take a single NFT token and use its unique information in a variety of different games and different contexts, while still retaining its value in the original blockchain game. The event also provided the ability for Crypokitty's users to create, buy, or win Gods Unchained-themed Cryptokitties, including creating one of 3,992 TallyThePurrocious fancy cats, buying one of 380 Aeoncat special edition cats, or winning the one and only Hyppurrion exclusive cat. Details can be found on the Cryptokitties Gods Unchained page . Decentraland crossover CryptoKitties are accessible in Picture Frames as part of the Decentraland Scene builder.

This includes up to three additional monsters that you'll need to catch and hang on to to trigger the transforming proress. Having ancestors present in the battle party increases the descendant's attack stats in battle. Monsters can have up to 3 forms and require a level minimum and ancestors present to transform. Some monsters can lay an egg create another monster, generally at a mid-30s level. Also some monsters lose the ability to lay an egg after transforming. Adventure Sites Part of the Etheremon adventure play is sending your monsters to Adventure Sites. These adventures cost a small entry fee, but a monster can find battle shards, level stones or even other monsters. The fee from the adventure cost is split among the 10 site owners. Currently the cost is 0.1 Ether or 15 EMONT. Battle Modes There are 2 types of battling: Ranked and Practice. Ranked mode battles include 3 one-on-one battles of attacking mosters, best 2 out of 3 wins. The 3 attacking monsters can be supported by 3 defending monsters. The supporting lineup is crucial to build strong teams. With wins trainers can increase their rank, while loses will decrease their rank. There are ranking competitions now and then where highest rank wins. Tournaments Tournaments consist of one-on-one battles against a pool of players where losing exits the competition for that tournament.

The game is free to download and includes a core set of 250 cards that can be unlocked by progressing through the game in both single player and multiplayer modes. Card expansion sets, called 'seasons', are available for purchase. The first of these seasons is called Genesis and includes 380 cards. Paid cards are verifiably scarce and have their stats and ownership history recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Gods Unchained also features other collectibles that grant special cosmetic benefits and can be displayed in matches against other players. All Gods Unchained gameplay occurs off-chain and incurs no transaction fees. Activating and Trading Cards Purchased Gods Unchained cards can be trustlessly traded using the 0x Protocol. When a card set is first introduced, trading is disabled during an initial balancing period where each card is checked to ensure it doesn't upset the balance of the overall game. The first set of tradable cards in Gods Unchained is the Genesis set. To trustlessly trade Gods Unchained cards, cards must first be 'activated' using a special transaction that turns them into ERC-721 tokens. Activating cards is not necessary for playing the game, nor is it necessary for trading a card purchased from a marketplace. Activation is only necessary for players wishing to trade a card for the first time. Game Mechanics Gods Unchained builds on the classic gameplay mechanics made famous by Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. New to Gods Unchained is an innovate new mana system that forces players to begin engaging on turn 1. The game also supports a massive variety of possible matches by giving each player the choice of up to five special god powers at the start of each match. Of these powers, four are always regular and one is an ultimate. Regular powers can be activated once per turn while an ultimate power can only be used once per match. Since the game has six gods to play with and each god can use one of five powers , there are 7776 possible match combinations in Gods Unchained. This enables more gameplay variety than has been possible before. Other gameplay features include a Rune system (i.e. special small spells), an Anim system (i.e. special small creatures) and a special mulligan and first/second turn system. Gods Unchained also supports Battle Royale style elimination tournaments and is expected to include more gameplay mechanics than any other trading card game at launch. History Open Beta Gods Unchained is currently in open beta. Downloading the apollo client and creating an account will get new players signed up and new beta players are being added daily. The global launch is expected late in Q3 2019. Etherbots crossover Etherbots , by the same studio Fuel Games, was originally launched in March 2018 and included battling completely on-chain. To promote interoperability Etherbots holders were rewarded with exclusive Gods Unchained cards for their early contributions. Etherbots 2 is expected after Gods Unchained is fully launched. CryptoKitties crossover On January 10th, 2019, a partnership between Gods Unchained and the kitty-breeding collectible game CryptoKitties was announced . Between Jan. 10th to Jan. 21st, 2019, CryptoKitty owners were able to forge statues in Gods Unchained, including a special Talisman based on a new fancy cat called Tally the Furrocious. 380 Special-Edition Gods Unchained Aeoncat Kitties were made available for purchase.

It allows anyone to buy and manage .eth domains without relying on a centralized domain registrar. The owner of a domain can map it to any string value. One example is creating a human-readable name for his Ethereum wallet by resolving a personal domain to it. The owner can also create and manage subdomains. Each domain has an owner, resolver, and time-to-live record and is stored in the ENS registry. Resolvers are smart contracts that can provide any information about given domain. Owner of the domain can choose a resolver and transfer the ownership of the domain as well as its subdomains. History Launch The ENS launched on May 4th, 2017 with a temporary registrar contract featuring a Vickrey auction design for registering domains. Vickrey Auction Process Explained First, someone looking to register an ENS domain was required to make a minimum bid of at least 0.01 ETH which opened an auction for the desired name. This started a 3-day timer for other people to place bids on the name. During this period, the details of bids were obscured: nobody could tell how much you bid, or even what name you were bidding on. After the three day auction finished, a two day \u201creveal\u201d period would begin. During this period, everyone who made a bid must have revealed the details of their bid\u200a\u2014\u200aif they didn\u2019t, they lost their entire bid. If your bid was not the highest, you were refunded your bid, minus a 0.5% fee which was burned. At the end of the two day reveal period, the winner was the person who revealed the highest bid, but they only had to pay the amount of the second-highest bidder. This amount was locked up in the contract as a deposit until the permanent registrar came. The winner was required to send a \u201cfinalise\u201d transaction to receive a refund of any extra funds, and to be assigned control of the name in ENS. Upgrade to Permenant Registrar At 00:00 UTC May 4th, 2019, the ENS was upgraded to a permanent registrar contract which did away with the Vickrey auction system in lieu of instant registration for ENS domains seven characters or longer. The new registrar requires domain holders to pay $5/year paid in Ether to main. Domains registered before this update are required to migrate to the new registrar but are not required to pay this yearly fee until after May 4, 2020. Registering an ENS domain Registering a domain on the ENS will cost you $5/year paid in Ether. See here for a step-by-step guide to registering an ENS domain. Registering ENS domain names shorter than 7 characters With the May 4th, 2019 update to the permenant registrar, ENS intends to start opening up registrations of names shorter than 7 characters. This will start with a preregistration process, during which owners of existing DNS domains can claim the corresponding ENS name for their project. After that, an auction process will start in which anyone can bid on the newly available names, and then finally open the rest up for instant registration. See here for more information.

The Dai Card uses payment channel hubs - a L2 solution built on top of Ethereum - to allow for instant and micro-fee transactions for users and developers. How to Use the Dai Card Getting Funds There are multiple ways to get funds onto your Dai Card. The first is to directly send funds (i.e. \"deposit\") to the Dai Card's address. You can deposit either ETH or Dai. If you deposit ETH, it will be instantly and automatically swapped into Dai at the current Eth-Dai price. Note: the beta version of the Dai Card imposes a $30 limit and will refund any deposits above this amount. You can also request funds from someone else who is already using a Dai Card. This can be done by clicking the request button and entering in how much you\u2019d like to request. A link will be generated and can be sent to the person you want to request from. The first transaction that is sent to your Card will take some extra time to execute. This is because, in the background, an onchain transaction is being done to set up your Card. Sending Funds There are two different ways to send funds. If the receiver already has a Dai Card and you know their address, then it\u2019s best to just use the simple send functionality. If the receiver has never used a Dai Card before, you can use a Link payment instead. Link payments generate an unspent payment object which can be \"claimed\" by the recipient that produces the correct secret. Note that the link generated here contains the secret to redeem funds in plaintext, so you should be careful with it. Settings It\u2019s possible to backup your Card's seed and restore it in any browser, at any time. You can also restore this seed in other wallets such as Metamask, MyCrypto or TrustWallet. However, this will not give you access to the channel funds themselves, only the signing key used to control those funds. FAQ When I deposit ETH into a Card and I receive Dai, is the ETH being automatically sold to Connext? A: Yes. Connext's payment channel hub automatically swaps any ETH for Dai that you deposit at market price. The swapped ETH then goes into the hub's collateral reserves, which is used either when users \"cash out\" in Eth or when more Dai needs to be bought by the Connext team. Since it's much easier for most users to get access to Eth than Dai (and to off-ramp to fiat from Eth), Connext expects that this will make it simpler to use Dai for everyday payments. If I deposit 1 ETH into a channel can I later withdraw 1 ETH from that channel? For example, if the price of ETH goes up while my ETH is in a channel and I then withdraw it, do I get the value of the ETH at the time of withdraw or at the time of deposit? A: No. You are swapping into Dai when you use the Card. Users have the benefit of being protected from volatility but, obviously, this means that you wouldn\u2019t see the upside of an Eth bull run. Since you're not meant to hold large amounts of value in your Card anyway (only daily spending cash), the upside that you would miss out on should be minimal. Is the Dai Card noncustodial? A: The concept of custodial is more nuanced for channels: In Connext's payment channel hub system, your funds are always your own since you can exit the system at any time by sending your latest channel state to the payment channel contract. This can be done regardless of the status of the hub - i.e. it is completely uncensorable. Note, this assumes that you have access to your channel state - the Connext team is still working on making sure that this will always be the case. A payment itself can be custodial. This means that for the brief moment that a payment is \"in-flight\", it can be intercepted and/or censored by the hub. Obviously, if this happened and you knew about it, you would exit the system so your financial risk is constrained by the size of the payment itself. Payments can also be noncustodial using more complex mechanisms (such as lightning-style HTLCs or, in Connext's case, a dispute-based system called \"threads). Connext's system is live with custodial payments for now. The noncustodial payment code is in the hub and client codebase as part of the launch, but the team is still working on making sure that the user experience of noncustodial payments is seamless, and so they have kept it deactivated for the initial launch. They plan to reactivate it within the first couple of weeks of going live. For a more in-depth breakdown of the current trust assumptions in the system and how the team plans to address them, please see Connext's Dai Card launch post here . What is the difference between this approach and Sidechain/Plasma approaches like xDai? A: The primary difference between channels and sidechains are that channels are a solution that scale up the existing blockchain whereas sidechains shift load out onto other chains. Because channelized systems can be built on top of any underlying chain, they are theoretically better for widespread horizontal infrastructure that aims to serve ALL users whereas sidechain/plasma based solutions are better for application-specific use cases. Think of the difference between the Visa network and Uber. At scale, sidechains and plasma suffer from the same scalability problems as the base chain, which would require creating further sub-chains or using channels to solve. Moving into and out of sidechains/plasma systems can be more difficult since it involves moving value across different chains, rather than within the base chain. In the event of a mass exit from the system (because the chain went down), it is also sometimes unclear how all users could move their value back onto the base chain. However, sidechains/plasma are much more flexible once within the system, do not require significant collateral lockuup to run, and do not require counterparties to be online/available. Channels, on the other hand, are easier to get into and out of. They are also much cheaper to run/scale and funds can always be exited onto the base chain no matter the circumstances. The downsides of channel networks are that they require intermediaries to hold collateral in order to ensure that a transaction will be completed and that they require that those intermediaries (and counterparties) to be available when a transaction occurs. Note that the availability requirements can be improved with better conditional payment functionality. Does Connext have to put reserves in the channel itself? Can this run or cap out? A: Yes. The ChannelManager contract (0xdfa6edae2ec0cf1d4a60542422724a48195a5071) has Eth and Dai reserves in it. All channels are automatically collateralized based on the reserves in this contract. If it runs out, channels would stop being collateralized and this would interrupt payments. If a channel stops being collateralized, how will users be alerted that payments are currently interrupted (e.g. does the UI show an alert and grey\u2019s out the SEND button)? How long might outages last, on average? A: The most noticeable instance of this occurring will be when a Card receives its first payment. For a standard payment, the sender's UI will state that the receiver's Card is still being set up and whill show a progress indicator. For a link payment, the redeem payment screen will state that the Card is being set up and will show a similar progress indicator. In both of these cases, collateralization of the channel occurs in the background and takes ~30-40s (block time + 2 block confirmations) to complete. Aside from these instances, most payments should be instant. Connext is still working on better ways to optmistically allocate collateral to channels so users can expect the user experience around this to improve with time.

Born as stablecoin project Havven, launched first USD pegged stablecoin in June 2018 . Havven rebranded as Synthetix and expanded its scope to a synthetic asset platform launching on mainnet December 2018 . As of June 2019, the Synthetix platform supports over 20 Synths representing fiat currencies, commodities (e.g., gold), and cryptoassets. Stocks, indices, and other derivatives are expected to be added soon. It is one of the only platforms that supports shorting some tokens via the Synthetic inverse tokens such as iMKR, iXTZ, iBNB, iETH, iBTC. Synthetix has explored novel incentive mechanisms in token economics, including an inflationary monetary policy, establishing a liquidity ramp on Uniswap for traders to enter and exit the Synthetix exchange, and creating a pool of SNX to reward arbitraguers who buy sETH when it is more than 1 basis point off its peg to ETH. Synthetix also created a first-of-its-kind Exchange Index Synth. How Synthetix Works Synthetix has a native token called SNX. Holders lock SNX as collateral to mint Synths, which are freely tradeable ERC20 tokens. Trading fees from Synths exchanged on Synthetix\u2019s non-custodial DEX, Synthetix.Exchange, go to SNX holders/Synth minters, incentivizing Synth creation and giving value to the underlying collateral (i.e., the SNX token). There are two types of staking rewards , SNX inflationary rewards and Synth exchange rewards, which are paid in SNX and sUSD respectively. Exchange rewards are generated by trades on Synthetix.Exchange. The exchange fee (either 0.30% or 0.50%) from each trade is sent to the fee pool where it is available to be claimed by staked SNX holders. To earn rewards from staking SNX , you need to mint sUSD using Mintr. Rewards can be claimed on a weekly basis for up to two weeks. If your Collateralisation Ration is below 675%, you cannot claim rewards until updating your Collateralisation Ration to be at least 675%. As of October 2019, SNX's 78.59% Staking Yield ranks in the top three of all digital assets , according to StakingRewards.com. The average staking yield is 12.66%. The SNX staking community is very active relative to its peers. The Average Stake Ratio among assets reviewed by StakingRewards.com is 37%, while 82% of SNX tokens are staked. Monetary Policy Synthetix initially started with supply of 100 million SNX ECR-20 tokens. In February 2019, shortly after the pivot from Havven to Synthetix, a new monetary policy was instituted to encourage staking on the platform while bootstrapping network effects. Recognizing the SNX token is fundamentally a work token, and not a currency whose primary purpose is purchasing power, the inflation schedule provides for a sequence of decreasing inflationary rewards to SNX stakers. Under the schedule, SNX increases in supply by 75 million from 100 million to 175 million from March 2019 to March 2020 (75% increase). Running up to March 2021, the SNX supply will increase from 175 million to 212.5 million (21% increase). In March 2022, the SNX supply will reach 231.25 million (9% increase. By March 2023, supply will grow to 240.625 million (4% increase). In March 2024, total supply will hit 245,312,500 SNX (2% increase). To mitigate instant dumping of SNX rewards by SNX stakers, which puts downward pressure on SNX price and therefore weakens the value of staked SNX collateral, SNX rewards distributed from March 2019 to March 2020 are locked and cannot be sold on the open market during this period. SNX earned from staking can be collateralized to mint new Synths, however. Uniswap sETH Pool Liquidity Incentive Mechanism In July 2019, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick announced \"an experiment we will be running for the next four weeks to test whether protocol level incentives lead to a deep liquidity pool for the sETH/ETH pair on Uniswap.\" Explaining the motivation for the experiment, Warwick said, \"Think of Uniswap as a gateway into the Synthetix ecosystem, in order to trade on sX you need to have Synths, which right now typically means converting ETH into sUSD. Once you have Synths you can trade on sX and take advantage of the infinite liquidity mechanism allowing you to convert between Synths. What happens though, when you are done trading and want to exit the system back into ETH? Unfortunately there is a significant cost to exit the system as slippage on Uniswap is high and the exchange rate between sUSD/ETH typically trades at a discount of 5-10%.\" The experiment tested how well an incentive of 72,000 SNX per week, 5% of inflation, could attract ETH holders to provide liquidity on Uniswap. \"This experiment will hopefully demonstrate a new kind of composability within the DeFi ecosystem, where protocols can combine incentives across protocols to align incentives in a symbiotic and self reinforcing fashion,\" Warwick said in a blog post at the time. In fewer than three months, the Synthetic Eth:ETH liquidity pool became the largest pool on Uniswap with more than 12,000 ETH and 12,000 sETH. The four-week experiment evolved into Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 8 . SIP 8 states \"The distribution will be managed by an m/n multisig contract with signers selected from LP providers...By implementing this distribution mechanism using a multisig, we prepare for the next phase of the project where the foundation can no longer modify distribution and other aspects of the system and begin to test aspects of decentralised goveranance.\" sETH:ETH Arbitrage Incentives To strengthen the soft peg between sETH and ETH, Synthetix introduced an arb contract to create an incentive for maintaining sETH:ETH parity. Following a successful experimentation of the arb contract over several weeks in August 2019, 2% of inflation was dedicated toward supporting the arb contract. According to a Synthetix blog post , \"If the sETH/ETH rate on Uniswap falls below 99/100, people can send ETH to the arb contract, which is then converted to SNX at par value. Essentially this means if the sETH ratio falls too low you can use this to exchange ETH to SNX at a discounted rate.\" Index Synths: sCEX and iCEX In August 2019, the first exchange index synths went live on Synthetix.exchange. Dubbed sCEX, the sCEX token represents a basket of tokens issued by the top centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the industry: Binance Coin (BNB), Bitfinex's LEO, Huobi's HT, Okex's OKB, and Kucoin's KuCoin Shares (KCS). This basket provides unique exposure to a new strain of synthetic assets that enables traders and investors to gain exposure to the price of several exchanges' tokens without having to own the underlying tokens or maintain an account with one of the represented exchanges. When sCEX was introduced, so too was iCEX born, which effectively enables beneficial exposure to downward price movement in the aforementioned tokens. Like iXTZ, iMKR, or iBNB, iCEX appreciates in price when its underlying components depreciate. This is akin to taking a short position, though the parameters of Inverse Synths makes the term inverse more appropriate. The inaugural sCEX and iCEX tokens are weighted as follows: BNB (50%), LEO (20%), HT (10%), OKB (10%) and KCS (10%.)

WBTC brings greater liquidity to the Ethereum ecosystem including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and financial applications. Today, the majority of trading volume takes place on centralized exchanges with Bitcoin. WBTC changes that, bringing Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity to DEXs and making it possible to use Bitcoin for token trades. WBTC standardizes Bitcoin to the ERC20 format, creating smart contracts for Bitcoin. This makes it easier to write smart contracts that integrate Bitcoin transfers. Maintaining various nodes and managing transaction types in order to support multiple currencies can be onerous. Now exchanges, wallets, and payment apps only need to handle an Ethereum node. WBTC DAO The addition and removal of merchants and custodians will be an open process controlled by a multi-signature contract. Keys to the multi-sig contract will be held by institutions as part of the WBTC DAO. Merchants Merchants perform key roles for the WBTC community and are sources of token distribution. They interact with custodians in order to mint and burn WBTC and provide KYC/AML for users. Custodians The custodian provides reliable, institutional-grade security for your WBTC. All WBTC issued will be fully backed and verified through on-chain proof of reserves. How it works Receiving To receive WBTC, a user requests tokens from a merchant. The merchant then performs the required KYC / AML procedures and verifies the user\u2019s identity. Once this is completed, the user and merchant execute their swap, with Bitcoin from the user transferring to the merchant, and WBTC from the merchant transferring to the user. Minting Minting refers to the process of creating new wrapped tokens. Minting in the wrapped framework is initiated by a merchant and performed by a custodian.

Decentralized Finance or \"DeFi\") refers to a number of decentralized protocols building open financial infrastructure. These protocols are valuable because they're creating the necessary plumbing to enable anyone in the world with an internet connection to access self-sovereign, censorship resistant financial services. In the existing system, all financial services are controlled by a central party. Whether it's basic money transfers, asset purchases, or lending, you must go through an intermediary who charges rent for mediating financial transactions. Ethereum-based financial services, on the other hand, connect individuals peer-to-peer and allow them to access basic financing more easily and affordably. How is all this possible? A big reason the financial services industry is as bloated as it is today is because financial transactions in the digital realm are not secure. We have no method of trusting our online counterparties so we pay fees to financial institutions who enforce that trust. Ethereum leverages the same principles that create 'digital trust' within Bitcoin, and applies to them to smart contracts, self-executing pieces of code that execute business logic after some predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts look a lot like financial contracts in that they escrow funds and transfer them around in response to certain events. This system is superior because the encoded business logic can't be manipulated by a central party once its deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. Blockchain based financial services are superior to their centralized counterparts across the following primary features: Permissionless : An internet connection is all you need to access these services Censorship Resistance : No central party is able to reverse the order of transactions and turn off the service Trustless : Users don't have to trust a central party to ensure that transactions are valid Transparent : Public blockchains like Ethereum are completely transparent and auditable Programmable : Developers can create and intertwine financial services at a very low cost Efficiency : Open financial services are powered by code, not humans, and as such entail much lower middleman costs, if at all Open Finance is generally broken up into the following categories: Asset Exchange Credit Scoring Insurance Indexing/Baskets Lending Derivatives Stablecoins Smart Securities Prediction Markets Open Source Banking Applications Resources Open Finance dApps on Ethereum","title":"What is Open Finance?"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/what-is-open-finance/#open-finance","text":"","title":"Open Finance"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/what-is-open-finance/#summary","text":"Open Finance (a.k.a.

The issuer publishes all required documentation, with the hash of the documents placed on-chain. In collaboration with the chosen legal delegate, they define a set of restrictions to comply with regulators. Investors can purchase tokenized securities from issuers as long as they fit the compliance criteria. They will need to work with one of the KYC providers to bind their identity with their Ethereum address. Once they are approved, they can trade security tokens on primary and secondary markets.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/securities/polymath/#resources","text":"Website","title":"Resources"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/securities/securitize/","text":"Securitize Summary The Securitize platform is a proven, robust, feature-rich platform with multiple successful issuances of digital securities on the blockchain.

A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, they\u2019re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the effects of price volatility, thus they seek to function as a store of value and a unit of account. To minimize volatility the value of a stablecoin can be pegged to a currency, or to exchange traded commodities (such as precious metals or industrial metals). Stablecoins backed by currencies or commodities directly are said to be centralized, whereas those leveraging other cryptocurrencies are referred to as decentralized. Types of Stablecoins Currency-backed Cryptocurrencies backed by currency (fiat) are the most common and were the first type of stablecoins on the market. Their characteristics are: Their value is pegged to one or more currencies (most commonly the US dollar, also the Euro and the Swiss franc). The peg is realized off-chain, through banks or other types of regulated financial institutions which serve as depositaries of the currency used to back the stablecoin. The amount of the currency used for backing of the stablecoin has to reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin. Notable currency-backed stablecoins: Gemini Dollar USD Coin Tether TrueUSD Paxos Standard Collateralized (crypto-backed) Cryptocurrency backed stablecoins are issued with cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is conceptually similar to fiat-backed stablecoins. However, the significant difference between the two designs is that while fiat collateralization typically happens off the blockchain, the cryptocurrency or crypto asset used to back this type of stablecoins is done on the blockchain, using smart contracts in a more decentralized fashion. For example, MakerDAO's DAI stablecoin is generated when someone opens a collateralized debt position (CDP), deposits some ETH as collateral, and then withdraws DAI from their CDP. The ETH acts as collateral. Notable collateral-backed stablecoins: MakerDAO - DAI Bitshares - BitUSD Synthetix - SUSD Seigniorage (algorithmic) Seigniorage (or algorithmic) stablecoins can be linked to a decentralized autonomous organization which controls issuance and pricing. The supply of algorithmic stablecoins is typically controlled by issuing and destroying coins depending on the market demand, until the target price is reached. In the general case, market participants are incentivized to act in a way that the price is kept at target level by issuing either bonds, in times of decreasing price or seigniorage shares when the price is above target. Notable algorithmic stablecoins: Basis (project was cancelled) Ampleforth Tethered (sub-type of algorithmic) Tethered cryptocurrency assets have certain features of algorithmic stablecoins \u2013 and can be considered their sub-type, except they don\u2019t offer incentives in form of separate instruments (bonds or shares) to holders of the \u201cunderlying\u201d cryptocurrency and there is no governing algorithm that forces the price towards the target, except at the moment of creation of the asset. Tethered cryptocurrency assets are issued on-chain, by holders of the native cryptocurrency, with different pegs chosen by the issuer.

Tellor utilizes a network of miners, required to stake 1000 TRB, competing to solve PoW challenges for the right to submit data to Tellor\u2019s on-chain price feed database.

They are essentially consensus protocols, which means that different nodes in the network (e.g. computers on the internet) have to be running compatible software. \u201cNode operators\u201d are the owners and managers of nodes that run the protocol. Most node operators don\u2019t want to write much software, and it\u2019s a technical challenge for anyone to independently write compatible implementations of any consensus protocol even if they have a specification. As a result, node operators rely on software repositories (usually hosted on Microsoft/Github servers) to provide them with the software they choose to run. \u201cCore developers\u201d of a blockchain are software developers who work on the software that implement that protocol. Developers have processes that are supposed to assure the quality of the software they release, and are generally very interested in maintaining the legitimacy of their software repositories because they want to see people using their software (as opposed to someone else\u2019s). Critical Components of Governance 1. Incentives Each group in the system has their own incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are advantageous for them. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power. 2. Mechanisms for Coordination Since it\u2019s unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another, it creates power imbalances in their favor. In practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains (such as Tezos or Polkadot), on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed. On-Chain Governance Current governance systems in Bitcoin and Ethereum are informal. They were designed using a decentralized ethos, first promulgated by Satoshi Nakamoto in his original paper. Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). What is on-chain governance? On-chain governance is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes are encoded into the blockchain protocol. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change. How does it work? Unlike informal governance systems, which use a combination of offline coordination and online code modifications to effect changes, on-chain governance systems solely work online. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. If the change is accepted, it is included in the blockchain and baselined. In some instances of on-chain governance implementation, the updated code may be rolled back to its version before a baseline, if the proposed change is unsuccessful. Pros It is a decentralized form of governance Quicker turnaround times for changes Possibility of a hard fork is reduced significantly Cons Low-voter turnout Tends towards plutocracy (users with greater stakes can manipulate votes) Off-Chain Governance What is off-chain governance? Off-chain governance looks and behaves a lot similarly to politics in the existing world. Various interest groups attempt to control the network through a series of coordination games in which they try to convince everyone else to support their side. There is no code that binds these groups to specific behaviors, but rather, they choose what\u2019s in their best interest given the known preferences of the other stakeholders. There\u2019s a reason blockchain technology and game theory are so interwoven. How does it work? Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). The various stakeholders signal their approval or disapproval for an improvement proposal through private and community discourse. Then, the core developers get a sense for whether or not node operators and miners will agree to upgrade their software. Ideally, all sides agree and the code changes are made smoothly. Everything is announced beforehand and stakeholders have time to update. In the case of disagreement, stakeholders have two options. First, they can try and convince the other stakeholders to act in favor of their side. If they can\u2019t reach consensus, they have the ability to hard fork the protocol and keep or change features they think are necessary.

The idea was that this marriage would lead to a platform that could sustain not only the money or medium of exchange use case, but also to add programmability to money, introducing conditional logic to the equation that would open up a world of possibilities with regards to decentralized financial applications and products, and additional decentralized applications. Initial ETH Distribution The Ethereum presale took place from Tuesday, 22 July 2014 to Tuesday, 2 September 2014, lasting a total of 42 days. The price of ether was initially set to a discounted price of 2000 ETH per BTC, and stayed that way for 14 days before linearly declining to a final rate of 1337 ETH per BTC. 60 Million ether was created for the presale of which 80% was available for purchase with 20% (or 12 Million) being retained by the Ethereum Foundations 'development fund' which consisted of early contributors to the project and developers. The presale ended with ~31,000 BTC (equivalent to ~$18.3 million) being raised by the Ethereum Foundation over the 42 days.

Ethereum's current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5% with 2 Ether per block and an additional 1.75 Ether per uncle block (plus fees) being rewarded to miners. Ethereum does not have a fixed supply because a fixed supply would also require a fixed security budget for the Ethereum network. Rather than arbitrarily fix Ethereum's security, Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as \"minimum issuance to secure the network\". Ethereum has had a history of reducing issuance to these estimated minimums and the network has never increased issuance. The move to proof-of-stake is also part of Ethereum's effort to reduce issuance to minimum amounts without sacrificing security. Ethereum's minimum necessary issuance policy is enforced by a wide range of stakeholders within the ecosystem - including: Developers Community members Ecosystem spokes/projects Miners and other network participants As Ethereum is a decentralized network, the Monetary Policy cannot be successfully modified unless there is overwhelming consensus from the aforementioned stakeholders. Ethereum follows an off-chain governance process meaning that any and all decisions on changes to the network happen extra-protocol. That said, due to natural incentives Ether's issuance is unlikely to ever increase unless the security of the network is at risk. And the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake transition will progressively allow for a drastic reduction of Ether issuance while maintaining the same level of network security. Important Events Genesis Block As part of the Ethereum genesis block, initial contributors to Ethereum sale were allocated 60,000,000 Ether. Another 12,000,000 Ether was given to the development fund which was distributed among early contributors and the Ethereum Foundation. Historical Issuance Impacts Block Reward Reductions Every block produced on the Ethereum network has an associated block reward which incentivizes miners to support the network. On top of the base block reward, miners that find an uncle block receive ~75% of the current block reward. This results in a growing supply of Ether across time. The history of the block reward are as follows: Block 0 to Block 4,369,999: 5 Ether Block 4,370,000 to 7,280,000: 3 Ether (changed via EIP-649 ) Block 7,280,000 to now: 2 Ether (changed via EIP-1234 ) Other Events Issuance rate is also impacted by the speed of blocks. There have been a few other events in Ethereum's history which has impacted the issuance rate. Some planned and some not planned. The Homestead fork in March 2016 saw a decrease in block times and therefore a temporary increase in issuance rate. In late 2016, the network was under DDoS attack. This increased the uncle rate, therefore causing a temporary rise in issuance rate. In mid 2017, a mechanism called the difficulty bomb (or \"Ethereum Ice Age\") started to kick in. This meant that the difficulty of mining a block rose, therefore slowing down blocks. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in issuance rate. In late 2017, the Byzantium fork was released which delayed the difficulty bomb and also reduced block rewards from 5 to 3. Proof of Stake Impact According to the current Eth 2.0 spec , issuance rate will be greatly reduced as a part of Proof of Stake. There will be a sliding scale between total amount of Ether at stake and annual interest earned by stakers.

Ethereum's current yearly network issuance is approximately 4.5% with 2 Ether per block and an additional 1.75 Ether per uncle block (plus fees) being rewarded to miners. Ethereum does not have a fixed supply because a fixed supply would also require a fixed security budget for the Ethereum network. Rather than arbitrarily fix Ethereum's security, Ethereum's monetary policy is best described as \"minimum issuance to secure the network\". Ethereum has had a history of reducing issuance to these estimated minimums and the network has never increased issuance. The move to proof-of-stake is also part of Ethereum's effort to reduce issuance to minimum amounts without sacrificing security. Ethereum's minimum necessary issuance policy is enforced by a wide range of stakeholders within the ecosystem - including: Developers Community members Ecosystem spokes/projects Miners and other network participants As Ethereum is a decentralized network, the Monetary Policy cannot be successfully modified unless there is overwhelming consensus from the aforementioned stakeholders. Ethereum follows an off-chain governance process meaning that any and all decisions on changes to the network happen extra-protocol. That said, due to natural incentives Ether's issuance is unlikely to ever increase unless the security of the network is at risk. And the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake transition will progressively allow for a drastic reduction of Ether issuance while maintaining the same level of network security.","title":"Summary: Minimum Necessary Issuance"},{"location":"ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/#important-events","text":"","title":"Important Events"},{"location":"ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/#genesis-block","text":"As part of the Ethereum genesis block, initial contributors to Ethereum sale were allocated 60,000,000 Ether.

On top of the base block reward, miners that find an uncle block receive ~75% of the current block reward. This results in a growing supply of Ether across time. The history of the block reward are as follows: Block 0 to Block 4,369,999: 5 Ether Block 4,370,000 to 7,280,000: 3 Ether (changed via EIP-649 ) Block 7,280,000 to now: 2 Ether (changed via EIP-1234 ) Other Events Issuance rate is also impacted by the speed of blocks. There have been a few other events in Ethereum's history which has impacted the issuance rate. Some planned and some not planned. The Homestead fork in March 2016 saw a decrease in block times and therefore a temporary increase in issuance rate. In late 2016, the network was under DDoS attack. This increased the uncle rate, therefore causing a temporary rise in issuance rate. In mid 2017, a mechanism called the difficulty bomb (or \"Ethereum Ice Age\") started to kick in. This meant that the difficulty of mining a block rose, therefore slowing down blocks. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in issuance rate. In late 2017, the Byzantium fork was released which delayed the difficulty bomb and also reduced block rewards from 5 to 3.","title":"Historical Issuance Impacts"},{"location":"ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/#proof-of-stake-impact","text":"According to the current Eth 2.0 spec , issuance rate will be greatly reduced as a part of Proof of Stake.

Summary Ether (ETH or \u039e) is the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network and is used to compensate miners who secure transactions. A planned upgrade to the Ethereum protocol in 2019-2021 would replace mining with a less computationally expensive Proof of Stake mechanism which will be secured by validators, who are also expected to receive a proportional compensation in Ether. Ether also has many current use cases, such as a store of value (e.g. in lending collateral), a medium of exchange (e.g. in trade and payments), and a unit of account (e.g. in digital marketplaces). Ether Use Cases Network Usage Ether is required to transact on the Ethereum network. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is the unit used to measure the computational power required to process a transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners are expected to be compensated for this task. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21,000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Store of Value Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors. It is used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions, including: used to pay Ethereum transaction fees (in the form of \u2018gas\u2019), used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications (MakerDAO, Compound), can be lent or borrowed (Dharma), accepted as payment by certain retailers and service providers use it as a medium of exchange to purchase Ethereum-based tokens (via ICOs or exchanges), crypto-collectibles, in-game items, and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs) earned as a reward for completing bounties (Gitcoin, Bounties Network). Furthermore, in Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), users will be able to become a validator and help secure the network by providing computational resources and locking up 32 Ether per validator. Due to this, it is expected that Proof of Stake will lock a substantial amount of the circulating supply of Ether. There are also discussions around introducing a \u2018fee-burn\u2019 model where a percentage of Ether used to pay transaction fees would be \u2018burned\u2019 and thus reduce the circulating supply of Ether. In addition to utility value, Ether also has speculative value. This is value that is derived from speculative activities (such as trading and investing) which currently accounts for most of the value behind all crypto-assets. As observed in 2017, crypto-assets can attract substantial speculative interest, with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months. This speculative interest often brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals, but it can be damaging to the short-term market sentiment of all crypto-assets. Can\u2019t tokens on Ethereum be used instead of Ether? Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The concept of using another asset to secure the Ethereum network is called \u2018economic abstraction\u2019 (a good primer can be found here . This would involve miners / validators accepting tokens other than Ether in exchange for adding valid transactions to new blocks. It is highly unlikely that the Ethereum protocol will ever implement economic abstraction as it could potentially reduce the security of the blockchain by compromising the value of Ether. How does valuable Ether help to secure the network? In Proof of Work systems, miners compete with each other to find a block and thus be rewarded for their work (in the form of the native crypto-asset of the protocol). As the price of the asset increases, it naturally brings with it more miners, which then increases the network difficulty. As the network difficulty increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for miners to find a block which results in large scale mining operations (commonly referred to as \u201cmining farms\u201d) being one of the only profitable ways to mine on a Proof of Work network (once it reaches a certain size). Miners can also join \u2018mining pools\u2019 in order to increase their chances of finding a block and thus increase their rewards. It would currently cost an individual or group a large amount of money to successfully attack or take control of either the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains When Ethereum transitions to Proof of stake under Ethereum 2.0, it is expected that users will be able to stake 32 Ether per validator and receive rewards for their work in the form of additional Ether (at a dynamic issuance rate , discussed later in this essay). Under Proof of Stake, the cost of attacking Ethereum will be tied to the cost of Ether. Instead of using energy intensive mining (as it is under Proof of Work), validators will \u201cstake\u201d Ether, and will lose part or all of their stake if they attempt to behave fraudulently. The more validators with staked Ether securing the network, the more Ether an attacker would need to purchase in order to carry out an attack. Such an attack would likely rapidly increase the price of Ether and thus make it prohibitively more expensive for the attacker. Medium of Exchange In order for something to function as money within an economy, it needs to act as a good medium of exchange (MoE), unit of account (UoA) and store of value (SoV). Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum economy for a wide range of apps, with dApp providers accepting it in exchange for fungible / non-fungible tokens, or other services. It is also used as a unit of account by various parties (including companies that have raised Ether via ICOs). Finally, Ether has historically been used as a store of value, with investors and speculators purchasing Ether to hold for investment purposes, given its relative scarcity, predictable supply growth, and inherent utility. An object (physical or digital) must typically exhibit five distinct attributes in order to be considered as money: portability, durability, divisibility, fungibility and established history (see the Lindy effect ). Ether is highly portable (because it\u2019s digital), durable (again, because it\u2019s digital), divisible (up to 18 decimal places), but has limited fungibility as ETH tokens are interchangeable with one another, but accounts/addresses can be blacklisted quite easily. Privacy protocols such as zk-SNARKs will eventually improve this property for Ethereum. Ethereum has been in operation since 2015 and continues to build a strong established history. The Ethereum network (and Ether) have functioned as expected for 99.99% of its life. The other 0.01% includes surviving The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets (including a recent 94% drop in price). On top of this, Ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permission-less, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks. The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties (especially those in the Bitcoin community) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply (like Bitcoin) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate (like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0). In Ethereum 2.0 (with Sharding and Proof of Stake implemented), while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it may dilute the value of Ether for those that are not validators. Though, this is offset by Ether being taken out of the circulating supply through staking, various open finance applications, fee burning, and people simply losing access to their Ether.

Summary Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed ledger featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.

Because it opens the door to a global financial system where an Internet connection is all you need to access applications, products and services that operate in a trustless manner. Anyone can interact with the Ethereum network and participate in this digital economy, without the need for third parties and without the risk of censorship.

While the word \"contract\" brings to mind legal agreements; in Ethereum \"smart contracts\" are just pieces of code that run on the blockchain and are guaranteed to produce the same result for everyone who runs them. These can be used to create a wide range of Decentralized Applications (DApps) which can include games, digital collectibles, online-voting systems, financial products and many others. The term \"Smart Contract\" was coined by Nick Szabo in the 90's. Szabo used the basic example of a vending machine to describe how real-world contractual obligations can be programmed into software and hardware systems. Everyone who puts the correct amount of coins into the machine can expect to receive a product in exchange. Similarly, on Ethereum, contracts can hold value and unlock it only if specific conditions are met. The scripting language used by Ethereum is Turing-complete, essentially meaning that the types of DApps users can design is limited only by their programming skills and creativity.

And surprisingly, it's actually not so hard in Ethereum development to get started with it! The Truffle framework makes it very easy to test contracts with Solidity and JS. Beware: while you can test contracts in Solidity, I highly advise you don't. The tooling is very nascent, and Solidity itself has very few libraries already - you won't be able to load test data (fixtures) from files for example, since Solidity doesn't have an FS API like JS/Node does. for unit testing simple functions, Solidity comes in handy. However you might find using Remix IDE just as quick for accomplishing this to start with (although you won't reap the benefits of having a test later when your code breaks ;)). Running a persistent test blockchain A persistent chain is often useful when you want to test a frontend UI, and you need to persist the data you've transacted onto a blockchain. You can use Ganache (n\u00e9e testrpc) CLI to do this: ganache-cli -d --db ./ganache --gasPrice 1 --gasLimit 10000000 --networkId 123 -u 0 -u 1 This will persist data to ./ganache and most importantly set the network ID (otherwise this is generated from system time on startup, and is not 'persistent' otherwise). Connecting MetaMask with your test blockchain wallets When you run Ganache CLI, it will list private keys on first launch in hex form. You can import these into Metamask and then access your 100 ETH issued by default. Gas You will probably encounter issues with gas. Note that contracts cannot be bigger than 24,000 bytes, and transactions no bigger than 32kb ( source ). Contract creations take gas, which you can estimate with estimateGas . Gas is the internal Ethereum unit for pricing computation, and is converted at a fixed rate to Ether (set by clients), termed the gasPrice . It is measured in the smallest unit, which is gwei. The gasLimit is the maximum amount of gas that can be used in one setting. An example of some gas arithmetic: estimateGas(YourContract) = 286056 # if we run a test blockchain with a gas price of 2 (2 units for 1 gwei) ganache-cli --gasLimit 100000000000 --gasPrice 2 then the minimum amount to send with the transaction is: 286056 * 2 = 572,112 gwei 0.000572112 ETH You might be tempted to set gasLimit to something like 1000000000000000 . This will break Metamask, as it can't encode that value into 53 bits for BigNumber ( see here ). Gas Units Unit Amount per ETH ETH 1 Finney 1,000 Szabo 1,000,000 Gwei 1,000,000,000 Mwei 1,000,000,000,000 Kwei 1,000,000,000,000,000 Wei 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Debugging Testing is important, but you will never ascertain as much information as to the execution of a contract as by using the official debugger tooling, the Remix IDE ( demo , docs ). Remix is a bit of a hack piece put together, but it works very well once you're using it correctly. It can run Solidity in a JavaScript VM, an injected Web3 provider (e.g. Metamask) or connect to your local Ganache / other setup on http://localhost:8545 . Using Remix like a pro Remix is a web app, so it doesn't have access to your file system (whether you access it from remix.ethereum.org or as an Electron desktop app). While you can copy-paste code in, it's much better to install remixd , which will expose a local folder to Remix. Install it globally and save the dep - npm install -g -S remixd Add this to your package.json . javascript { \"scripts\": { \"remix\": \"remixd -s .\", } } Run yarn remix remixd knows to look into node_modules for imported contracts (e.g. SafeMath) from packages like OpenZeppelin, so we run it in our project root . rather than in ./contracts as you might assume. Unit testing Unit testing is for testing individual functions of your contracts. Integration testing Integration testing generally requires multiple interactions from various users/contracts. Since this requires the use of multiple addresses, it is unsuitable to accomplish in Solidity as above. Exposing contracts You may encounter difficulty testing contracts due to the (in)visibility of methods/types, the lack of insertion point for validating data being returned, and so on. It is possible to test not the contract itself, but a wrapped contract for testing purposes only. contract Market { uint[] private orders; function doSomething() {} } How would we access Market.orders here? contract MarketForTesting is Market { function getOrdersCount() public returns (uint8) { return orders.length; } } Testing return values When you call a method on a contract, and it updates state (i.e. is not view / pure ), it must be transacted upon the network. In such case, the Web3 interfaces do not give you the return value of the method. This can be frustrating if you're trying to test such a value, so you can do something like so: async function txWithReturnValue(method, ...args) { let [retval, tx] = await Promise.all([ method.call(...args), method.sendTransaction(...args) ]); return retval; } await txWithReturnValue(Contract.method, 1, 0x123 , { from: 0x12312 , value: 2 }); Testing with various 'users' You will want to test the contract's interaction from the POV of multiple users with different addresses (whether it be human or other contracts). This is quite easy to achieve. Whenever you transact with a contract in calling a method, you have the option to specify the from address of who will be funding the tx. Below is a Truffle test which combines this with access to accounts , which is the same output as web3.personal.getListAccounts: const MyContract = artifacts.require( ./MyContract.sol ); contract('MyContract', async (accounts) = { it('tests with various users', async () = { let instance = await MyContract.new(); for(let i = 0; i 5; i++) { let from = accounts[i]; console.log(`Submitting tx from addr: ${from}`); let txid = await instance.yourMethod.sendTransaction(arg1, arg2, { from, }); } }) })","title":"Testing"},{"location":"ethereum-basics/development/testing/#testing","text":"Not only does Test-Driven Development make your codebase stellar, it's extremely useful when interacting with a new language with different semantics.

Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) won't be fully rolled out for another 2-3 years with Phase 0 and Phase 1 due within 1-2 and Phase 2 due sometime in 2022. Ethereum 2.0 is being deployed as a seperate blockchain so it does not supersede ETH 1.0 which means the chain needs to be sustainable for another 5-10 years. Eth1.x is a result of a group of Ethereum core developers and friends discussing the current challenges of Ethereum at Devcon IV and realising that they all share a similar view - that the Ethereum mainnet, if left unchanged, would become very hard or impossible to use due to severe performance degradation and increased storage requirements. Performance degradation mostly due to the large (and increasing) state size. Increased storage requirements mostly due to keeping blocks, event logs (receipts), and state history (currently prunable in major clients). The 1.x set of improvements will introduce major, breaking changes to the mainnet, while 2.0 (aka Serenity) undergoes prototyping and development in parallel. The plan for 1.x encompasses three primary goals: (1) mainnet scalability boost by increasing the tx/s throughput (achieved with client optimizations that will enable raising the block gas limit substantially); (2) ensure that operating a full node will be sustainable by reducing and capping the disk space requirements with \u201cstorage rent\u201d; (3) improved developer experience with VM upgrades including eWASM. Pre-History of Ethereum 1.x October 2017, Devcon3 in Cancun Vitalik Buterin presents \"Modest proposal for Ethereum 2.0\" , suggesting that Layer 1 of Ethereum 1.0 should stay \u201csafe and conservative\u201d, and most of the innovation go into Layer 2 and into shards. May 2018, EDCON in Toronto Vitalik Buterin gives a talk \u201cSo you want to become Casper validator?\u201d , signaling that Casper FFG validators may be running on laptops and rollout is getting close. June 2018 Casper FFG research is merged with sharding due to challenges of implementing Casper FFG as a contract, and due to large overlap with Sharding research, as discussed at the Core Dev Meeting 40 . October-November 2018, Devcon IV in Prague It becomes apparent that Serenity (full Casper + Sharding) is not going to functionally supersede Ethereum 1.0 for another 3-5 years. Main Objectives Develop, formalize, and implement set of measures, deployable on the Ethereum 1.0 mainnet, within the next 2 years, to ensure that the chain stays viable and usable. That mainly means curbing the state growth or limiting the state size. Emphasize focus on these measures and de-emphasize introduction of specific \u201cfeatures\u201d. This is one of the places where eWASM engine comes in. Current computational pre-compiles are seen as features requiring case-by-case work. Introduction of eWASM engine would first enable \u201cpre-compile\u201d factory, where more pre-compiles are introduced faster. Later it would enable any contracts written in eWASM, obviating the need for pre-compiles altogether. Working groups State rent (now called as state fees because it might not be just rent) eWASM Storage pruning Simulation and Emulation State Rent Proposal framework Since State rent is a potentially higher impact change (and therefore more controversial, possibly unpopular) than any other changes within Ethereum 1.x, it requires a clear logical framework for designing, evaluating, and comparing proposals. This framework attempts to ensure, as much as possible, that the change plan eventually chosen is likely close to the best available. It defines the path of reasoning from \u201cWhat is the problem (what happens if we do nothing)?\u201d to \u201cHow exactly we are doing it\u201d. Current location of the proposal framework document (Work in progress) Alexey explains the idea of state rent - \"to charge people not once when they start using storage and then paying them back a certain amount if they free it up again, but actually charging people by the day or by the block based on the storage that they're using, and if they decide that they don\u2019t need these things anymore they can just withdraw their Ether or they just leave it and then it will be garbage collected by the rent\". Reasoning questions Why is state a valuable resource and to whom? (can this value be replicated) Why state size needs to be managed? (effect on system performance + possible partial mitigations) How can state size be managed? (feedforward vs feedback control) What metrics need to be regulated? (state size, state growth, or both) Do metrics need to be in-state or off-state? What parameters (control inputs) do we use? (cost of state expansion, charge per size unit per block) Can controlled system weaken or evade control? (dark rent, miner rebates) How can we get active contracts that are using lots of storage to pay a rent that more accurately represents the cost of storing that data permanently on-chain over a period of time? (Linear cross-contract storage could be a solution here) How can we clear the state of abandoned contracts that are not being used anymore? (This problem is not addressed in any such proposal as abandoned contracts represent only 6% of the state) How about keeping rent simple and maximally effective at the protocol level and completely deleting anything which runs out of funds? (Bad Idea, Users forget about some application they are involved in all the time) Moving portions of the smart contracts data off chain? (A subprotocol is needed for the delivery) \"Say you have a smart contract now and it uses storage so it has to pay rent. So it has to have funds or someone needs to pay funds on behalf of it. So what happens if no one pays?\" Under all three of the current proposals, when the smart contract exhausts its balance and the rent balance, they are considered two separate things. So when both of these balances are empty, an eviction happens. Eviction, under the current proposals, doesn\u2019t just happen automatically - somebody actually has to 'poke' the contract. Poking means that somebody has to create a transaction which touches it to access it in some way. For non contracts, eviction means just removing from the state as it doesn't have any information at all but for contracts, there's storage, so eviction doesn't completely remove it from a state but it leaves a so-called stub which is essentially the commitment to the entire state of the contract before the eviction, and this stub, unfortunately has an effect that it does not completely remove it from the state so it has to still dangle there, but this stub is what allows us to restore it later on. Let's take an example , \"if you had a multisig wallet with lots of tokens in it and then you've forgotten to pay the rent, the multisig is \"gone\" but you would still be able to use the recovery mechanism to rebuild the storage of this contract in another contract and simply use a special code to restore it from the stub - then the contract comes \"back to life\". You can also top up the rent and then keep using the contract or you can move the things elsewhere.\" The stub is expected to be a 32 byte hash which is a commitment to what the contract looked like before it was evicted. How is this different from stateless contracts? The difference is that in stateless contracts we assume that when the contract is represented as a stub it\u2019s still accessible by the normal operations. In this proposal, when the contract is in hibernation state (ie when it\u2019s a stub) it\u2019s not accessible by anything. It\u2019s basically invisible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine( EVM ) with the exception of this special opcode, which it\u2019s restored to, and only that opcode can see that stub - nothing else can. Is this the best solution? This is not a perfect solution as if we find that there are lots of little contracts having the hash stubs and then the state is still not small enough. Watch the whole talk where Alexey explains state rent and more about Eth 1.x. Current proposals There are currently three proposals being worked upon: Introduce rent on all accounts (contracts and non-contracts), existing and newly created ones, with the ability to restore evicted contracts. Current location Introduce fund lock-up when state is expanded (creation of accounts, adding store items), which is partially released when the state is cleared. Apply rent only on the pre-existing state. Current location * Increase the cost of state expansion in \u201cshort term\u201d, to enable block gas limit increase before state rent is implemented Challenges inherent to most proposals How will existing dApps be affected? Will they become too expensive/cumbersome to use? Will they need to be optimized/rewritten completely? Denomination of the extra state expansion charge or rent - should it be priced in gas, ETH, and how should be the price be determined (feedback loop on the state size?). Will volatility of ETH price affect those charges too much? Will miners help users evade charges? Classes of contracts and impacts Part of the state rent research is to identify main classes of contracts that are likely to be affected by the changes in the protocol, and provide guidelines on what they can do about it. Likely important classes: ERC20 token contracts and applications managing them (DAI, Augur) On-chain order books (DEXs) Ethereum Name Service ENS Non-fungible token contracts Multi-signature wallets Gaming contracts Gambling contracts Resources State Fees Proposal Alexey explains State Fees eWASM Enhancement to the Ethereum protocol is currently hindered by the inflexibility of the Ethereum Virtual Machine( EVM ) architecture. The method of extending the execution layer has been the introduction of special \u201cprecompile\u201d contracts. The use of WebAssembly as a virtual machine specification for executing high-performance \u201cprecompile\u201d contracts promises to streamline the process of introducing such contracts. eWASM is a subset of Wasm, Wasm has a couple of features which are non-deterministic, we need to eliminate them by validating contract while deploying. If contract uses non-deterministic features then it's rejected. The current proposal is to use an even smaller subset of eWASM (only allowing precompiles to be written as eWASM). Main unresolved questions Gas metering Memory allocation Interaction with the rest of EVM state (e.g. contract storage, balances) Interpreter/compiler guarantees on compilation time and runtime Gas metering Two main approaches: Injection. Wasm bytecode gets pre-processed. An extra register is added to serve as a gas counter. It gets incremented at certain points (jumps, calls) and out-of-gas check is performed. Pro: generic. Con: performance overhead. Automatic upper bound estimation. Static analysis is performed on the bytecode, and, for some subset of codes, upper bound of executed instructions (virtual gas) can be calculated. Pro: no performance overhead. Con: only subset of codes Current approach for the 1st phase (pre-compiles) is upper-bound based. Memory allocation Wasm semantics dictates that its execution has a linear memory (only one in the current version of the spec) that can be grown on demand. Will that linear memory be allocated every time the engine is called and then torn down at the end of the execution? If yes, how much more efficient is this compared to the current EVM model (which does this allocation and tearing down at each CALL opcode). Interaction with the rest of EVM state This was proposed via external functions, for example (name made up): function_SLOAD(storage_index: uint256) The alternative approach is not to have eWASM code access EVM state, but only exchange input/output when called. This, of course, makes maintaining large persistent data structures difficult. Interpreter/compiler guarantees Initially, this problem was brought up in the context of JITs (Just In Time) compilers. JIT compilers were one of the reasons why WebAssembly was a big performance improvement over JavaScript. JIT compilers might be problematic in an adversarial environment because it is usually possible to find a program that takes an unusually long time to compile, and algorithms that decide what to compile \u201cjust in time\u201d can be targeted too. AOT (Ahead of Time) compilers can be used for Core Dev-controlled pre-compiles (Phase 1). For Phase 2, the plan was to initially use very straightforward interpreters, and then develop AOT compilers with necessary guarantees. The idea of first introducing interpreters is to make sure eWASM is there, giving people more motivation to work on the compilers (which is harder than interpreter) Resources eWASM Proposal eWASM Design Storage Pruning Ethereum 1.0 has a storage scaling issue. Yes, the rate of growth itself is implicitly limited by the block gas limit, but there is no limit on the total amount of data accumulated over time. Also known as Chain Pruning, this group is not related to state directly instead it is concerned with the growing size of logs, blocks, data, etc. \"If Ethereum were to grow at its current rate, 91 GB would be added per year to storage\", according to the core team. Storage Pruning is necessary and seeks to place a cap on Ethereum's data storage growth. Part of the proposal includes the deletion of historical blocks, logs, and indexes. The questions to be answered are: What do we absolutely need to keep to comply with the Ethereum protocol? Do we always need to keep all the blocks? (maybe not, if we use backward sync, for example) Do we need to keep receipts, or just logs, how much (in Gigabytes), or for how long? Do we need to always download the entire header chain or can we compress it (with STARK proofs for example)? Can we improve snapshot sync procedures (fast sync, warp sync) so that they prevent invalid state transitions (with Validity Proofs, for example)? How to handle removal of history The first challenge to solve with regard to pruning historical chain segments is to ensure that we can prove the past even though we've deleted the past. There are two possible approaches for this: Maintain a Merkle (or other cryptographic) proof of deleted chain segments Light clients work exactly like this and that's why are able to sync in a couple of minutes. Instead of having to go through all the headers from genesis, light clients are hard coded (or fed from the config file) a trusted checkpoint, which they start syncing from. This mechanism has two issues however: To keep sync fast, we constantly have to update the hard coded snapshots or the config file. This works for mainnet with an active maintenance schedule, but does not scale for private Ethereum networks. If no release is made, sync currently takes longer. If however the full nodes would start deleting old headers themselves, old checkpoints would become useless, forcing devs to constantly issue new releases and users to constantly pull new releases. It just doesn't scale. Maintain the header chain indefinitely It solve all of the issues that the Merkle proof mechanism has, you can always fast sync based on the header chain with only the genesis. The downside is that opposed to the Merkle proof, which is 32 bytes for arbitrary history, keeping the headers available indefinitely means indefinite chain growth. Garbage Collection If we agree on an N month/block retention policy, whenever the chain progresses, each client would delete bodies and receipts older than HEAD-N. This has an implication on the RPC APIs too however. We need to introduce the concept of a \"vitual genesis block\" (open for better names) which define the point of history before which the APIs cannot return data (or return that they don't maintain it any more). Block/Receipt Archives Archiving historical chain segments so they remain available for later reconstruction if need be is the hardest part of this proposal. So where to store these archives, internally or externally: Extra-protocol storage means hosting the data files on classical external servers, mirrored and replicated according to our security needs: FTP, S3, CDNs, etc. These could be archived by major players (Ethereum Foundation, Consensys, Parity Technologies, Internet Archive, etc). Access to these could boil down to dumb web requests. Intra-protocol storage means hosting the data files within some of the nodes in the Ethereum network itself: Swarm/devp2p, IPFS/libp2p, BitTorrent, etc. The archives would still be run by the same major players, but running an archive would be approachable to anyone, thus closer to the ethos of decentralization. Since the whole point of Ethereum is decentralization, the only option we have is intra-protocol. However there are many methods by which we can store the archives in a decentralized way. Some of them are listed here: Swarm (but not production ready) IPFS (accessing is easy, hosting is hard) BitTorrent LES/PIP Broken Invariants Pruning historical chain segments breaks a few important invariants within the Ethereum ecosystem: DApps will no longer be able to access events past the retention policy. Nodes will have no way of knowing if a transaction was already deleted, or never existed in the first place. It will be harder for nodes to do a full sync, a full sync on Ethereum mainnet with current Geth takes about 5 days, 4 days out of which is the last 2.7M blocks. If we bump the transaction throughput to 10x, apart from very special users, nobody will be able to do a full sync, nor will want to really. Resources Pruning Proposal Simulation and Emulation What are the tools that we can use to support the other groups like State Rent and the chain pruning group, to run some test scenarios and try to predict what problems that we\u2019re going to face in the future? Simulation and Emulation group produces data for making projections, benchmarks, and parameter calibrations for other groups. The working group is tasked with developing three setups: A simulation framework that, when a dataset is entered, produces an output to estimate properties of proposed changes (such as uncle rate reduction and gas limit increases). Currently Wittgenstein is suggested. An emulation framework that alters environment conditions to test properties of launched changes * A testnet that launches these changes together on the same network Simulation handles models of the software agents (in our case Ethereum client software instances), coarse enough to be performant, and fine enough to capture the important facets of the agents. Emulation handles the actual software agents (in our case the actual implementations of Ethereum like geth and parity), placed into the virtual environments with lots of freedom to change parameters of virtual machines and the network connecting them. Potential questions that simulation may be able to answer: Will uncle rate become much less of an indicator of the network congestion if most of the Ethereum nodes propagate blocks straight after verifying Proof Of Work (instead of fully processing the block as they used to do)? Potential questions that emulations may be able to answer: What is the function that describes the relationship between the rate of success for snapshot synchronizations (fast sync, warp sync) and things like prevailing bandwidth and state history pruning threshold? Developers are in the process of collecting datasets for simulation and finalizing parameters for simulation (one of which might be uncle rate). Properties to test Block propagation, to reduce uncle rate If yes, raise gas block limit If yes, consider increasing cost of storage wrt compute Determining what the next bottleneck is (a) Assume compute time is reduced (b) Assume bandwidth limit results in many uncles Dataset Preparation Datasets are being collected here from various sources like WhiteBlock , etherscan etc. Resources Simulation Proposal Deliverables Measures requiring hard-forks: State rent (or state growth limiting) eWASM Measures likely not requiring hard-forks, but requiring cross client code coordination on the network protocol: Storage pruning Resources Ethereum 1x Definition (part 1) Ethereum 1x Definition (part 2) Ethereum 1x Definition (part 3)","title":"Ethereum 1.x"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-1.x/#ethereum-1x","text":"","title":"Ethereum 1.x"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-1.x/#summary","text":"Ethereum 1.x is a codename for a comprehensive set of upgrades to the Ethereum mainnet intended for near-term adoption.

Performance degradation mostly due to the large (and increasing) state size.

So where to store these archives, internally or externally: Extra-protocol storage means hosting the data files on classical external servers, mirrored and replicated according to our security needs: FTP, S3, CDNs, etc. These could be archived by major players (Ethereum Foundation, Consensys, Parity Technologies, Internet Archive, etc). Access to these could boil down to dumb web requests. Intra-protocol storage means hosting the data files within some of the nodes in the Ethereum network itself: Swarm/devp2p, IPFS/libp2p, BitTorrent, etc. The archives would still be run by the same major players, but running an archive would be approachable to anyone, thus closer to the ethos of decentralization. Since the whole point of Ethereum is decentralization, the only option we have is intra-protocol. However there are many methods by which we can store the archives in a decentralized way. Some of them are listed here: Swarm (but not production ready) IPFS (accessing is easy, hosting is hard) BitTorrent LES/PIP Broken Invariants Pruning historical chain segments breaks a few important invariants within the Ethereum ecosystem: DApps will no longer be able to access events past the retention policy. Nodes will have no way of knowing if a transaction was already deleted, or never existed in the first place.

First, we have the need to migrate existing ether over and secondly, we have to transition the state of the chain over. Ether Migration The current proposal is that in phase 0 , users on the Eth 1.0 chain will be able to lock their ether up in a contract and will be credited with that same amount of ether on the Beacon Chain in Eth 2.0. At that point, they can stake that ether and begin to earn rewards on the Eth 2.0 chain. However, there is also some community interest in creating a two way bridge for that ether between the 1.0 and 2.0 chains. Pros and cons of each bridge are found below. One-way bridge Pros Cons Steady security, deposits can only go up High lockup risk for early stakers (at least ~1.5 years) Less complexity for early stages Potential for two coins via futures market Keeps forks isolated to each chain Fragmented community/economics Two-way bridge Pros Cons Less risk of lockup, more deposit inflow High volatility of total stake Keeps just a single ETH coin, no Beacon ETH (BETH) ( only if issuance of Eth 1.0 is changed ) Additional code complexity in early stages If issues arise with Eth 2.0, can bring coins back Risk of lockup is absent, will likely see more games played on early code Having a one-way bridge promises security, less complexity, but the lockup risk is significant as ether from Eth 1.0 is effectively burned. Transfers in phase 0 have been disabled since version 0.6.0 of the spec , with no current plans of being re-enabled. As resuming validator duties is tied to the transfer mechanism, this also means that if you decide to stop validating for a bit, you can't resume validating until such a time as the transfer functionality is implemented. Danny Ryan tells us more about why two-way bridge is not included in phase 0: \"The more we encumber the 1.0 consensus with 2.0, the more we tie the development and fork processes which would likely slow down the shipping/iterating on 2.0. It is not technically infeasible. It would require 2.0 light clients to be run by all 1.0 clients and some changes to the 1.0 consensus rules allowing for a similar burn/receipt method in the opposite direction. If we were to create fungibility, the path would be (1) release 2.0 beacon chain, (2) once stable beacon chain and light clients exist then require 1.0 clients to be light clients of 2.0 and finalize 1.0 with 2.0 and expose beacon chain state root to 1.0 (3) add additional consensus rules to 1.0 and 2.0 to handle the reminting on 1.0 with proof of burn on 2.0. I think it would be detrimental to 2.0 development to demand fungibility out the gate. Over time as light clients are released and we begin to finalize 1.0 with 2.0 if the community wants fungibility, then we can assess proposals then. ...we can't prove things about the beacon chain until we force 1.0 clients to agree on the current state of the beacon chain (thus the light client requirement). That's why it logically falls after finalizing 1.0 if the community really wants it.\" Validators will also be able to sell their Eth 2.0 ether balance to another validator, presumably at some discount to the prevailing ether price due to the lock-up and risks. Nonetheless, anyone can exit with funds if they really need to. This is a nice feature that will hopefully encourage more participants to feel comfortable committing to staking. Using BETH on shard chains (for smart contracts) will be available in phase 2. State Migration The current proposal is that in phase 2 , the state of the current Eth 1.0 chain will be transferred into a shard on the Eth 2.0 chain. At this point, all information from the Eth 1.0 chain will be available on the Eth 2.0 chain. Currently Lighthouse is working upon a state transition library . Again, quoting Danny Ryan: \"Once the state execution layer is in the new 1024 shards, users will be able to transfer ETH directly to the shards from the PoW chain. In the long term, the plan is to roll the PoW state into one of the shards.\" Replacing EVM with eWASM? Ethereum-flavoured web assembly is a deterministic smart contract execution engine built on the modern, standard WebAssembly virtual machine. It was first proposed in EIP 48 . It may be the future execution engine for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and is the primary candidate to replace EVM (the Ethereum virtual machine) as part of the phase 2 of Ethereum 2.0 roadmap. Buterin also thinks that the EVM should be retired soon and contracts should be on Ewasm with an EVM interpreter ( source ). Since EVM makes use of 256-bit bytecode, smaller computations have to be converted to 256-bit strings before the EVM can process them. The WASM code, however, has been designed with production in mind. The elimination of precompiling is an added advantage for eWASM. WASM is an open standard (backed by Google, Microsoft, Apple) and because of this it will allow more programming languages (C/C++, JS, Go) to be used for smart contract development (Solidity included). Challenges There are speculations that phase 2 might be divided into sub-forks and there will be a fork during/after phase 2 to bring in the Eth 1.0 state into a contract. \"A dapp will have to choose what shard it wants to be on and that decision will matter because cross-shard communication will definitely be slow at base layer,\" according to Buterin. Raul put forward some good questions regarding migration during the implementers call . Before we migrate the state there's going to be validators earning rewards, and overall the cumulative issuance of ether will go up. So what will be the economics of ETH throughout?

This means that rather than pay miners to secure the network, we will be paying validators to secure the network. It's vitally important to get the economics of staking right so that the network stays healthy and secure. If the incentive to stake is too low, the network will not get the minimum amount of validators needed to keep many shards going. If the incentive is too high, the network is overpaying for security and inflating at a rate that is detrimental to the economics of the network as a whole. There are a few considerations when it comes to how many validators the network \"needs\". According to the latest spec, the recommended minimum validators per committee is 111. At 1024 shards that would be 113,664 validators and 3,637,248 total ETH staked. To achieve crosslinks on all shards within 1 epoch, the committee size would be 256. That equates to 8,388,608 total ETH at stake on the network. Having less is fine it just means crosslinks become rarer. Terms NOTE: Some of these are taken from https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md Validator - a participant in the Casper/sharding consensus system. You can become one by depositing 32 ETH into the Casper mechanism. Committee - a (pseudo-) randomly sampled subset of active validators. When a committee is referred to collectively, as in \"this committee attests to X\", this is assumed to mean \"some subset of that committee that contains enough validators that the protocol recognizes it as representing the committee\". Issuance Rate - The annualized rate at which ETH supply grows. Issuance - The annualized rate at which validators are rewarded (in ETH). Validator Economic Incentive There are many things that a user will consider when wanting to become a validator. In the base case, some users may believe in the Ethereum network so much that they would stake at a loss if need be. A good example of this is the 12,000 Ethereum nodes running today. However, in the simplest case we can break down the thought process as follows: Total Incentive to Stake = Validator Rewards + Network Fees - Cost to run a Validator *One factor discussed later that validators will consider as well is competition. Staking Rewards In order to incentivize those that have ETH to stake in the network, there must be some type of reward. It's unlikely that many people would stake their ETH for no reward. Serenity accomplishes this by paying validators a reward for every block they successfully propose and attest. This reward is a sliding scale based on total network stake. So if total ETH stake is low, the issuance rate goes up and as stake rises, it starts to fall. The current suggested payouts are as follows: ETH validating Max annual issuance Max annual network issuance % Max annual return rate (for validators) 1,000,000 181,019 0.17% 18.10% 3,000,000 313,534 0.30% 10.45% 10,000,000 572,433 0.54% 5.72% 30,000,000 991,483 0.94% 3.30% 100,000,000 1,810,193 1.71% 1.81% According to Vitalik Buterin , these are maximum numbers and there are many factors that can decrease the total issuance amounts. They are: Validators going offline. Combining the individual and collective penalties, every 1% of validators offline cuts total issuance by around 3%, and if more than 33% ever go offline at once many coins could get burned quickly. Validators getting slashed. Probably will happen infrequently in practice. Transaction fees being burned due to EIP 1559 (estimate ~10k ETH/year initially while usage is still low, ramping up to hopefully hundreds of thousands of ETH/year eventually) Transaction fees being burned to pay for state rent (this mechanism could possibly be folded into the gas mechanism and hence the EIP 1559 burn) According to Justin Drake , this could result in the 30,000,000 staked figure about resulting in 0.5% network issuance and 5% staker return. Fees Validators earn a cut of the transaction fees that people pay to use the network. This is one area that needs more research but currently, the Ethereum network is paying about 600 ETH a day in fees. At current rate that's 219,000 ETH a year. How this will scale up as we add shards and throughput to the network will be important because it goes into the reward calculation. Staking Costs and Risks Validating and earning rewards is not a free lunch. There are many things to consider for one to become a validator. These factors will be considered by every validator when contemplating if the staking rewards are \"worth it\". They are: Computing cost Users will need to run validators clients at a minimum and likely a beacon node as well. This requires computing resources. Beacon Node: similar to running geth/parity today, will want to run 1 of these. Validator client: lightweight and need one per 32 ETH stake. Rough estimates on costs are $120/year for a beacon node and $60/year per validator client. Capital acquisition and lockup The user must acquire the necessary 32 Ether either via purchase or mining. Stakers can't directly sell staked Ether while it's staked. If the user wants to withdraw funds, there is a set amount of time they must wait to get their ETH back. However, this time has come down considerably in the latest versions of the spec. The minimum withdraw queue wait is 18 hours. This could go up if a lot of people are exiting at the same time but 18 hours will likely be the norm. Code Risk There is some code risk involved in staking that users will take into account. This will be more of a concern early on and likely dissipate over time. It's important to distinguish between client side code risk and consensus code risk. If the network runs into a consensus code break, the network will hard fork and fix it, so that's less of a concern. However, client side code risk is more serious because it'll be hard to distinguish that from a malicious fault. General uptime and maintenance cost Users need to make sure their validator doesn't have downtime or they risk a quadratic leak on their stake. If a user has multiple validators, maintenance cost and worry of the infrastructure comes into play. Security risk Beyond failures in the client code, stakers are responsible for the security environment of their validator clients (internet connection, operating system, hardware, etc.). If their validator client gets hacked due to a security failure, leading to forced downtime and/or misbehavior, there's currently no way to recover funds.

This means that rather than pay miners to secure the network, we will be paying validators to secure the network. It's vitally important to get the economics of staking right so that the network stays healthy and secure. If the incentive to stake is too low, the network will not get the minimum amount of validators needed to keep many shards going. If the incentive is too high, the network is overpaying for security and inflating at a rate that is detrimental to the economics of the network as a whole. There are a few considerations when it comes to how many validators the network \"needs\". According to the latest spec, the recommended minimum validators per committee is 111. At 1024 shards that would be 113,664 validators and 3,637,248 total ETH staked. To achieve crosslinks on all shards within 1 epoch, the committee size would be 256. That equates to 8,388,608 total ETH at stake on the network.

However, in the simplest case we can break down the thought process as follows: Total Incentive to Stake = Validator Rewards + Network Fees - Cost to run a Validator *One factor discussed later that validators will consider as well is competition.","title":"Validator Economic Incentive"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-economics/#staking-rewards","text":"In order to incentivize those that have ETH to stake in the network, there must be some type of reward. It's unlikely that many people would stake their ETH for no reward. Serenity accomplishes this by paying validators a reward for every block they successfully propose and attest. This reward is a sliding scale based on total network stake. So if total ETH stake is low, the issuance rate goes up and as stake rises, it starts to fall. The current suggested payouts are as follows: ETH validating Max annual issuance Max annual network issuance % Max annual return rate (for validators) 1,000,000 181,019 0.17% 18.10% 3,000,000 313,534 0.30% 10.45% 10,000,000 572,433 0.54% 5.72% 30,000,000 991,483 0.94% 3.30% 100,000,000 1,810,193 1.71% 1.81% According to Vitalik Buterin , these are maximum numbers and there are many factors that can decrease the total issuance amounts. They are: Validators going offline. Combining the individual and collective penalties, every 1% of validators offline cuts total issuance by around 3%, and if more than 33% ever go offline at once many coins could get burned quickly. Validators getting slashed. Probably will happen infrequently in practice. Transaction fees being burned due to EIP 1559 (estimate ~10k ETH/year initially while usage is still low, ramping up to hopefully hundreds of thousands of ETH/year eventually) Transaction fees being burned to pay for state rent (this mechanism could possibly be folded into the gas mechanism and hence the EIP 1559 burn) According to Justin Drake , this could result in the 30,000,000 staked figure about resulting in 0.5% network issuance and 5% staker return.","title":"Staking Rewards"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-economics/#fees","text":"Validators earn a cut of the transaction fees that people pay to use the network.

There are many things to consider for one to become a validator. These factors will be considered by every validator when contemplating if the staking rewards are \"worth it\". They are: Computing cost Users will need to run validators clients at a minimum and likely a beacon node as well. This requires computing resources. Beacon Node: similar to running geth/parity today, will want to run 1 of these. Validator client: lightweight and need one per 32 ETH stake. Rough estimates on costs are $120/year for a beacon node and $60/year per validator client. Capital acquisition and lockup The user must acquire the necessary 32 Ether either via purchase or mining. Stakers can't directly sell staked Ether while it's staked. If the user wants to withdraw funds, there is a set amount of time they must wait to get their ETH back. However, this time has come down considerably in the latest versions of the spec. The minimum withdraw queue wait is 18 hours. This could go up if a lot of people are exiting at the same time but 18 hours will likely be the norm. Code Risk There is some code risk involved in staking that users will take into account. This will be more of a concern early on and likely dissipate over time. It's important to distinguish between client side code risk and consensus code risk. If the network runs into a consensus code break, the network will hard fork and fix it, so that's less of a concern. However, client side code risk is more serious because it'll be hard to distinguish that from a malicious fault. General uptime and maintenance cost Users need to make sure their validator doesn't have downtime or they risk a quadratic leak on their stake. If a user has multiple validators, maintenance cost and worry of the infrastructure comes into play. Security risk Beyond failures in the client code, stakers are responsible for the security environment of their validator clients (internet connection, operating system, hardware, etc.). If their validator client gets hacked due to a security failure, leading to forced downtime and/or misbehavior, there's currently no way to recover funds.

It is kept up to date on a best-effort basis. Introduction Ethereum's major network upgrade, dubbed Ethereum 2.0, Eth2 or Serenity, will bring with it Sharding, Proof of Stake, a new virtual machine (eWASM) and more. It\u2019s important to understand that this upgrade will not take place at a single point in time - instead, it will be rolled out in phases. This document attempts to be a reference point for these phases and what each one includes. Design Goals Ethereum researcher Danny Ryan has stipulated 5 distinct design goals for Ethereum 2.0: Decentralization: to allow for a typical consumer laptop with O(C) resources to process/validate O(1) shards (including any system level validation such as the beacon chain). Resilience: to remain live through major network partitions and when very large portions of nodes go offline. Security: to utilize crypto and design techniques that allow for a large participation of validators in total and per unit time. Simplicity: to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency. Longevity: to select all components such that they are either quantum secure or can be easily swapped out for quantum secure counterparts when available. Phase 0 - Beacon Chain What is included? Phase 0 is the name given to the launch of the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain will manage the Casper Proof of Stake protocol for itself and all of the shard chains. As Ben Edgington puts it , \u201cThere are a number of aspects to this: managing validators and their stakes; nominating the chosen block proposer for each shard at each step; organizing validators into committees to vote on the proposed blocks; applying the consensus rules; applying rewards and penalties to validators; and, being an anchor point on which the shards register their states to facilitate cross-shard transactions.\u201d The primary source of load on the Beacon Chain will be \"attestations\". Attestations are availability votes for a shard block and, simultaneously, proof of stake votes for a beacon block. A sufficient number of attestations for the same shard block will create a \"crosslink\" which confirms the shard segment up to that shard block into the Beacon Chain. Phase 0 will use Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) for finality. Finality, in very loose terms, means that once a particular operation has been done, it will forever be etched in history and nothing can revert that operation. ETH2: The New Ether Phase 0 will introduce ETH2 which will be a new asset for stakers (validators) to be used on the Beacon Chain. It will be created using two methods: As a reward for validating the Beacon Chain (and shards after Phase 1). Purchasing it for 1 ETH by any ETH1.X user via a registration contract . The contract refers to it as a deposit. There is currently no way to withdraw or transfer ETH2 from the Beacon Chain in Phase 0. Once deposited in the ETH1.x validator registration contract, the ETH1 is effectively burned. Beacon Chain validators watch this contract and submit deposit information to the Beacon Chain, which then issues ETH2 to the depositors. Lastly, the Beacon Chain will generate good quality (distributed, verifiable, unpredictable, and (reasonably) unbiasable) randomness for the rest of the system. It will use RANDAO which is simply a way to combine contributions (individual random numbers) provided by many participants into a single output number. This will be used to organize validators into block proposers and committees. What will the network look like? Once Phase 0 is complete, there will be two active Ethereum chains. For the sake of clarity let\u2019s call them the Eth1 chain (current, PoW main chain) and the Eth2 chain (new Beacon Chain). During this phase, users will be able to migrate their ETH from the Eth1 chain to the Eth2 chain and become validators. However, they will NOT be able to migrate this ETH back (for now). The reason someone may want to do this is that they could be earning interest paid in ETH on the Eth2 chain. In order to run the Beacon Chain, you\u2019re going to need a Beacon Chain client. These are currently being developed separately from the familiar suite of standard Ethereum clients (Geth, Parity, Pantheon, et al.) by a number of teams . Most of the teams are putting out periodic updates on their client development progress, and some of the teams are offering bounties to contributors to include more and more developers in building 2.0. You can contribute on Gitcoin grants here On its own, the Beacon Chain might not seem particularly useful. But, as the first component of Ethereum 2.0 to be delivered, it is the foundation of the entire system. Important Considerations ETH2 is transferable to and from shards once Phase 2 is complete (though this may change in the future). There will be a minimum amount of ETH stake needed in order to first bootstrap the beacon chain. This is defined as CHAIN_START_FULL_DEPOSIT_THRESHOLD in the deposit contract that will live on the Eth 1.0 chain . To become a validator, you'll need to stake 32 ETH2. During Phase 0, all user transactions and smart contract computations will still occur on the Eth1 chain. Phase 1 - Shard Chains What is included? Shard chains are the key to future scalability as they allow parallel transaction throughput and there will be 64 of them deployed in Phase 1 (with the option of adding more over time). Phase 1 is primarily concerned with the construction, validity, and consensus on the data of these shard chains. Phase 1 does not specify shard chain state execution or account balances. It'll be like a trial run for the sharding structure rather than an attempt to use shards to scale. The Beacon Chain will treat shard chain blocks as simple collections of bits with no structure or meaning. Crosslinks Periodically, the current state (the \u201ccombined data root\u201d) of each shard gets recorded in a Beacon Chain block as a crosslink. When the Beacon Chain block has been finalised, the corresponding shard block is considered finalised, and other shards know that they can rely on it for cross-shard transactions. Crosslinks are a set of signatures from a committee attesting to a block in a shard chain, which can be included into the Beacon Chain. Crosslinks are the main means by which the Beacon Chain \"learns about\" the updated state of shard chains. Crosslinks also serve as infrastructure for asynchronous cross-shard communication. Shard validators, who are randomly selected by the Beacon Chain for each shard at each slot, merely come to agreement on each block\u2019s content. They attest to the shard\u2019s contents and state through crosslinking. It doesn\u2019t matter what information appears in shards blocks, so long as all committees reach consensus and update the Beacon Chain on the shard regularly. What will the network look like? The Eth1 and Eth2 chains will still operate in parallel after Phase 1. Important Considerations In Phase 0, 1, and 2 the main PoW chain (Eth1) will remain live while testing and transitioning is happening on the Eth2 chain. This means that rewards will be paid to both Ethereum 2.0 validators as well as the normal PoW block rewards. Therefore, the combined inflation of the twp chains may spike initially but then start to trend towards the 0-1% range as the PoW chain is gradually de-emphasized. Phase 2 - State Execution What is included? Phase 2 is where the functionality of the entire system will start to come together. Shard chains transition from simple data containers to a structured chain state and Smart Contracts will be reintroduced. Each shard will manage a virtual machine based on eWASM . It'll support accounts, contracts, state, and other abstractions that we\u2019re familiar with from solidity. We can expect familiar tools like truffle, solc, ganache ported to support eWASM before or during Phase 2. Phase 2 also introduces the concept of 'Execution Environments (EEs)'. EEs within a shard can be constructed in whatever way a developer sees fit - there could be an EE for a UTXO-style chain, a Libra-style system, an EE for a fee market relayer and beyond. Every shard has access to all execution environments and has the ability to make transactions within them as well as run and interact with smart contracts. Do note that the concept of execution environments is still in heavy research and development. Important Considerations A dApp will have to choose what shard it wants to be on. That decision matters because cross-shard communication differs on Eth2 as it is not synchronous which means some composability is lost between shards A dApp would have to have rather large data to consume all the resources in a given shard to justify spreading itself over multiple ones. This phase will endow shards with eWASM as the EVM 2.0. It is an open question when and how Ethereum 1.0 accounts and contracts will be migrated to Ethereum 2.0, there are some upgrade plans What's next ? The sharding roadmap according to the official wiki suggests 6 phases. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake strongly believes that the sharding Phase 1 and 2 will come in 2020 and 2021, respectively (assuming that the Beacon Chain launches in early 2020). From Phase 3 onwards any speculation made is subjected to change, you can go and check out the wiki for further phase's information.

It is considered an improvement over Proof of Work (PoW) because of less consumption of electricity, reduced centralization risks, security against different types of 51% attacks, and more. PoS can be classified into two major types: Chain-Based: Rely on the synchronicity of the network BFT-Based: Favour consistency of nodes over availability To participate in voting (i.e. to become a validator) you are required to stake ETH for which you'll be rewarded with additional ETH at some interest rate in addition to receiving a portion of the network transaction fees. What is Proof of Stake Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in the network. In Proof of Work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency. In general, a PoS algorithm looks as follows. The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the blockchain's base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum's case, ETH) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their ETH into a deposit. The process of creating and agreeing to new blocks is then done through a consensus algorithm in which all current validators can and are expected to participate. There are many kinds of consensus algorithms, and many ways to assign rewards to validators who participate in the consensus algorithm, so there are many \"flavors\" of PoS. From an algorithmic perspective, there are two major types: chain-based and BFT-style PoS. In chain-based PoS, the algorithm pseudo-randomly selects a validator during each time slot (e.g. every period of 10 seconds might be a time slot), and assigns that validator the right to create a single block, and this block must point to some previous block (normally the block at the end of the previously longest chain), and so over time most blocks converge into a single constantly growing chain. In BFT-style PoS, validators are randomly assigned the right to propose blocks, but agreeing on which block is canonical is done through a multi-round process where every validator sends a \"vote\" for some specific block during each round, and at the end of the process all (honest and online) validators permanently agree on whether or not any given block is part of the chain. Note that blocks may still be chained together; the key difference is that consensus on a block can come within one block, and does not depend on the length or size of the chain after it. What are the benefits of Proof of Stake over Proof of Work? No need to consume large quantities of electricity in order to secure a blockchain. (It's estimated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum burn over $1 million worth of electricity and hardware costs per day as part of their consensus mechanism.) Because of the lack of high electricity consumption requirements there is not as much need to issue as many new coins in order to motivate participants to keep participating in the network. It may theoretically even be possible to have negative net issuance, where a portion of transaction fees is \"burned\" thus decreasing the supply over time. Proof of Stake opens the door to a wider array of techniques that use game-theoretic mechanism design in order to more effectively discourage centralized cartels from forming and, if they do form, from acting in ways that are harmful to the network (such as selfish mining in Proof of Work). Reduced centralization risks, as economies of scale are much less of an issue. $10 million of coins will get you exactly 10 times higher returns than $1 million of coins, without any additional disproportionate gains because at the higher level you can afford better mass-production equipment, which is an advantage for Proof of Work. Ability to use economic penalties to make various forms of 51% attacks vastly more expensive to carry out than Proof of Work. To paraphrase Vlad Zamfir, \"it's as though your ASIC farm burned down if you participated in a 51% attack\". What would the equivalent of a 51% attack against Casper look like? There are four basic types of 51% attack: Finality reversion: validators that already finalized block A then finalize some competing block A', thereby breaking the blockchain's finality guarantee. Invalid chain finalization: validators finalize an invalid (or unavailable) block. Liveness denial: validators stop finalizing blocks. Censorship: validators block some or all transactions or blocks from entering the chain. In the first case, users can socially coordinate out-of-band to agree which finalized block came first, and favor that block. The second case can be solved with fraud proofs and data availability proofs. The third case can be solved by a modification to PoS algorithms that gradually reduces (\"leaks\") non-participating nodes' weights in the validator set if they do not participate in consensus; the Casper FFG paper includes a description of this. The fourth is most difficult. The fourth can be recovered from via a \"minority soft fork\", where a minority of honest validators agree the majority is censoring them, and stop building on their chain. Instead, they continue their own chain, and eventually the \"leak\" mechanism described above ensures that this honest minority becomes a 2/3 supermajority on the new chain. At that point, the market is expected to favor the chain controlled by honest nodes over the chain controlled by dishonest nodes. Staking Logistics Why would I want to stake my ETH? For staking your ETH and attesting to correct blocks, you will be rewarded with additional ETH through a network wide interest rate as well as receive a portion of network transaction fees. Details can be found here . What are the minimum requirements to stake? A minimum of 32 ETH per validator Computer with sufficient hardware specs Internet connection What software do I need to run to stake? There are two main types of software to be aware of when considering staking on Ethereum: Beacon nodes: This is the hub for your validators. Stores canonical state, handles peers and incoming sync, propagates blocks and attestations. Has a gRPC server that clients can connect to and provides a public API. Validator clients: Talks to your beacon node and signs blocks. You can have multiple of these at 32 ETH each. Stores important secrets such as RANDAO reveal, proof of custody for shared data, and BLS private key. Can swap underlying beacon nodes efficiently. Tracks shared state execution data and data blobs that the validator has signed. This means that there are three possible combinations of software to run: Beacon node only Beacon node + validator client Beacon node + multiple validator clients What are the hardware requirements to run this software? Still TBD. Ideally we can get minimum requirements for all three setups mentioned above. What happens if I lose my internet connection while staking? The key to being a validator is to ensure that you are consistently available to vote for blocks which in turn secures the network. Therefore, there is a slight penalty if your validator client goes offline at any point, in order to encourage validator availability. There are two scenarios where this can happen: If blocks are finalizing and you're offline, you can lose x% of your deposit over a year where x=current_interest For example, if the current interest rate is 5%, you would lose 0.0137% of your deposit every day, but gain that for every day you're online. If blocks aren't finalizing ( 33% of validators are offline) and you're offline, you can lose 60% in 18 days. If at any point your deposit drops below 16 ETH you will be removed from the validator set entirely. How long is my Ether locked up if I stake? There is a withdraw queue that you are placed into when wanting to withdraw ETH from your validator. If there is no queue, then the minimum withdraw time is 18 hours and adjusts dynamically depending on how many people are withdrawing at that time.

It is considered an improvement over Proof of Work (PoW) because of less consumption of electricity, reduced centralization risks, security against different types of 51% attacks, and more. PoS can be classified into two major types: Chain-Based: Rely on the synchronicity of the network BFT-Based: Favour consistency of nodes over availability To participate in voting (i.e. to become a validator) you are required to stake ETH for which you'll be rewarded with additional ETH at some interest rate in addition to receiving a portion of the network transaction fees.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/proof-of-stake/#what-is-proof-of-stake","text":"Proof of Stake (PoS) is a category of consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator's economic stake in the network. In Proof of Work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency. In general, a PoS algorithm looks as follows. The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the blockchain's base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum's case, ETH) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their ETH into a deposit. The process of creating and agreeing to new blocks is then done through a consensus algorithm in which all current validators can and are expected to participate. There are many kinds of consensus algorithms, and many ways to assign rewards to validators who participate in the consensus algorithm, so there are many \"flavors\" of PoS. From an algorithmic perspective, there are two major types: chain-based and BFT-style PoS. In chain-based PoS, the algorithm pseudo-randomly selects a validator during each time slot (e.g. every period of 10 seconds might be a time slot), and assigns that validator the right to create a single block, and this block must point to some previous block (normally the block at the end of the previously longest chain), and so over time most blocks converge into a single constantly growing chain. In BFT-style PoS, validators are randomly assigned the right to propose blocks, but agreeing on which block is canonical is done through a multi-round process where every validator sends a \"vote\" for some specific block during each round, and at the end of the process all (honest and online) validators permanently agree on whether or not any given block is part of the chain. Note that blocks may still be chained together; the key difference is that consensus on a block can come within one block, and does not depend on the length or size of the chain after it.","title":"What is Proof of Stake"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/proof-of-stake/#what-are-the-benefits-of-proof-of-stake-over-proof-of-work","text":"No need to consume large quantities of electricity in order to secure a blockchain. (It's estimated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum burn over $1 million worth of electricity and hardware costs per day as part of their consensus mechanism.) Because of the lack of high electricity consumption requirements there is not as much need to issue as many new coins in order to motivate participants to keep participating in the network. It may theoretically even be possible to have negative net issuance, where a portion of transaction fees is \"burned\" thus decreasing the supply over time. Proof of Stake opens the door to a wider array of techniques that use game-theoretic mechanism design in order to more effectively discourage centralized cartels from forming and, if they do form, from acting in ways that are harmful to the network (such as selfish mining in Proof of Work). Reduced centralization risks, as economies of scale are much less of an issue. $10 million of coins will get you exactly 10 times higher returns than $1 million of coins, without any additional disproportionate gains because at the higher level you can afford better mass-production equipment, which is an advantage for Proof of Work.

A tradeoff is necessary (you can choose any two but not all)\". Sharding is an attempt to solve this challenge. It simply means partitioning large chains (databases) into smaller, faster ones hence making the entire system more scalable. How? To solve scalability, we split the state and history stored on the main chain into shards. Each shard manages itself, has its own transaction history, and the effect of transactions in some shard are limited to that shard only. Examples for this would be: A dApp having a whole shard by himself so that all tx's related to it will be on that one shard only. Several dApps related to a particular domain will be on one single shard. The later phases of ETH2.0 considers the possibility of cross-shard communications. Sharding also introduces different types of nodes like \"Light Node\", \"Super-Full Node\" etc. depending upon how much data it downloads, how much it verifies. The Scalability Trilemma The Scalability Trilemma claims that blockchain systems can only, at most, have two of the following three properties: Decentralization (defined as the system being able to run in a scenario where each participant only has access to O(c) resources, i.e. a regular laptop or small VPS) Scalability (defined as being able to process many transactions) Security (defined as being secure against attackers with up to O(n) resources) The key challenge of scalability is finding a way to achieve all three at the base layer of a blockchain - sharding is one such attempt at solving this challenge. What is sharding? Currently, in all blockchain protocols, each node stores the entire state (account balances, contract code and storage, etc.) and processes all transactions. This provides a large amount of security, but greatly limits scalability: a blockchain cannot process more transactions than a single node can. In large part, because of this, Bitcoin is limited to ~3-7 transactions per second, Ethereum to 7-15, etc. However, this poses a question: are there ways to create a new mechanism, where only a small subset of nodes verifies each transaction? As long as there are sufficiently many nodes verifying each transaction, then the system is still highly secure. But a sufficiently small percentage of the total validator set that the system can process many transactions in parallel, could we not split up transaction processing between smaller groups of nodes to greatly increase a blockchain's total throughput? What is the basic idea behind sharding? We split the state and history of Ethereum up into partitions that we call \u201cshards\u201d. For example, a sharding scheme on Ethereum might put all addresses starting with 0x00 into one shard, all addresses starting with 0x01 into another shard, etc. In the simplest form of sharding, each shard also has its own transaction history, and the effect of transactions in some shard are limited to the state of shard of that same shard. One simple example would be a multi-asset blockchain, where there are many shards and where each shard stores the balances and processes the transactions associated with one particular asset. In more advanced forms of sharding, there exists some form of cross-shard communication capability, where transactions on one shard can trigger events on other shards. / What might a basic design of a sharded blockchain look like? There exists a set of validators (ie. proof of stake nodes), who randomly get assigned the right to create shard blocks. During each slot (eg. an 8-second period of time), for each shard in [0...999] a random validator gets selected, and given the right to create a block on a shard, which might contain up to, say, 32 kb of data. Also, for each shard, a set of 100 validators get selected as attestors. The header of a block, together with at least 67 of the attesting signatures, can be published as an object that gets included in the \"main chain\" (also called the beacon chain). Note that there are now several \"levels\" of nodes that can exist in such a system: Super-full node - downloads the full data of the beacon chain and every shard block referenced in the beacon chain. Top-level node - processes the beacon chain blocks only, including the headers and signatures of the shard blocks, but does not download all the data of the shard blocks. Single-shard node - acts as a top-level node, but also fully downloads and verifies every collation on some specific shard that it cares more about. Light node - downloads and verifies the block headers of main chain blocks only; does not process any collation headers or transactions unless it needs to read some specific entry in the state of some specific shard, in which case it downloads the Merkle branch to the most recent collation header for that shard and from there downloads the Merkle proof of the desired value in the state.

Commit-chains are the generic term for what is also called 'Plasma' - a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum and other blockchains. Vitalik Buterin has jokingly said, \"Commit chains\" is more on-brand for bitcoin whereas \"plasma\" is more on-brand for ethereum. Commit-chains, also sometimes described as non-custodial side chains, don\u2019t introduce a new consensus mechanism like side chains - they rely on the parent-blockchains consensus which makes them as safe as the parent-blockchain itself. In commit-chains, untrusted and non-custodial operators facilitate the communication between transacting parties. The operator is expected to commit the state of user account balances by sending periodic updates to the parent-blockchain. How do commit-chains work? Unlike payment channels, commit-chains are on an always ongoing state once launched and don\u2019t rely on a three-state - opening, live, dispute/closure - model. After an operator launches a commit-chain, users can join and conduct transactions that are recorded on the commit-chain while keeping the freedom to withdraw or exit their assets to the parent-blockchain at any time. Periodic Checkpoint Commitments Commit-chain users may need to periodically observe on-chain checkpoint commitments, which can be instantiated as a Merkle tree root or Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). While ZKPs enforce consistent state transitions on-chain, Merkle root commitments do not, requiring users to participate in challenge-response protocols to challenge operator misbehavior. Data Availability Requirement Users must retrieve and maintain data required to exit a commit-chain since data isn\u2019t broadcasted. Depending on the implementation, if the data is unavailable, you are either forced to exit (like in Plasma) or the operator can be challenged to provide the necessary data (like in NOCUST). On misbehavior, users are allowed to exit with their last confirmed balance. Centralized but Untrusted Intermediary The centralized operator never holds custody of funds so if the operator is not available the worst-case scenario is that users are just unable to make any further off-chain transactions, but they can exit and move to another commit-chain at any time. Transaction Finality Unlike payment channels, the commit-chain operator does not require on-chain collateral to securely route payments between users. Commit-chain transactions do not offer instant transaction finality like payment channels but offer eventual finality after an on-chain checkpoint. However, if an operator chooses to allocate collateral to each user, essentially implementing a payment channel on top of a commit-chain, instant transaction finality becomes possible. Reduced Routing Requirements A single commit-chain can potentially host millions of users, so a few statically connected commit-chains are envisioned to spawn stable networks with low routing complexity. Atomic cross commit-chain transactions have not been proposed yet. Commit-chain security properties The user-side security properties can be generalized as follows: Agreed transition A commit-chain transaction is agreed by at least the sender and the commit-chain operator. Balance security Honest users can always withdraw agreed balances from the commit-chain with an on-chain dispute. Balance security is provided for honest users even if the operator and all other commit-chain users collude since transactions are only considered final when the sender and operator agree to the payment and it\u2019s committed with the periodic on-chain checkpoint. State progression Users can, at any time, enforce an off-chain state transition on-chain. Commitment integrity Since there isn\u2019t a fixed 3-phase lifetime for a commit-chain, users of the commit-chain are able to verify the integrity of the operator\u2019s commitments at any point in time and force the operator to seize operation and rollback to the previous periodic commitment. NOCUST commit-chain Overview The concept of 'NOCUST commit-chains' was first introduced by the team at Liquidity Network and their peers in the form of an academic paper . NOCUST is an account-based commit-chain where an on-chain address is associated to a commit-chain account. The NOCUST on-chain contract expects to periodically receive a constant-sized commitment to the state of the commit-chain ledger from the operator containing each user\u2019s account in the collateral pool. Free establishment Users can deposit any amount of coins within the contract and perform commit-chain payment of any denomination towards other users and with free establishment, users can join the commit-chain without on-chain transaction by requesting an operator signature and immediately receive commit-chain transactions. Agreed transition A transaction within NOCUST is enacted with the signature of the sender and the operator to deter potential double-spend scenarios. Instant transaction finality State progression is only possible if the operator stakes collateral towards the recipient. NOCUST specifies a mechanism to allocate collateral towards all commit-chain users within a constant-size on-chain commitment, which enables instant transaction finality for specified amounts. Allocated collateral is reusable after each on-chain checkpoint and at this point, the transaction throughput is only limited by the operator\u2019s bandwidth and computational throughput - independent of checkpoint commitment interval. Commitment integrity Each user is only required to verify their own balance proof by requesting data from the operator and comparing it with their locally stored state at regular time intervals to observe integrity. In the case of misbehavior, a user can issue a challenge using the NOCUST smart contract. If the operator comes back with invalid information or does not respond, users have an accountable proof of misbehavior. NOCUST supports a provably consistent mode of operation through zkSNARKS. Layer two-state transitions will be validated by the underlying smart contract and the operator is unable to commit invalid state transition without being halted. Comparing commit-chains Comparing NOCUST commit-chain with Plasma Cash, which is the most comprehensive working draft of a Plasma implementation. Comparison data is based on the systemization of knowledge academic paper and sourced from discussions with Georgios Konstantopoulos .

NOCUST uses ZKPs to enforce consistent state transitions on-chain, Plasma Cash uses Merkle root commitments, which do not and require users to participate in challenge-response protocols to challenge operator misbehavior.

This enables running smart contracts at scale while still being secured by Ethereum. These constructions resemble Plasma, but trade the almost infinite scalability of Plasma to run an EVM compatible Virtual Machine called OVM (Optimistic Virtual Machine) which enables ORs to run anything Ethereum can. The name Optimistic Rollups originates from how the solution works. 'Optimistic' is used because aggregators publish only the bare minimum information needed with no proofs, assuming the aggregators run without commiting frauds, and only providing proofs in case of fraud. 'Rollups' is used because transactions are commited to main chain in bundles (that is, they are rolled-up). A Simple Overview Much like most Layer-2 solutions, the funds transacted on Optimistic Rollups are stored in a smart-contract on Ethereum, where users deposit funds, aggregators sign up and fraud proofs are commited. The usual process one can interact with such solutions are as follows: A user sends a deploy transaction of a smart contract off-chain to an aggregator (a block producer in this construction) An aggregator locally deploys the transaction creating the new smart contract That aggregator computes the new state root (aka a merkle root) That aggregator creates an Ethereum transaction which contains that state root calculated in step 3 Any user that sees an aggregator deploying an invalid state root (a state root created by including invalid transactions) can challenge that aggregator by posting the valid state root along with the merkle proofs required to prove it, slashing (removing a portion of the bond) and the aggregator that commited such fraud and any that built blocks on top of the fraudulent one and claiming those rewards. After an invalid block has been commited and a fraud proof is finalized, the chain in layer 2 can be rolled back and resume from the previous non-fraudelent block. Note: Anyone can become an aggregator as long as they lock a bond in the smart contract. Note 2: The front-running problem associated with step 5 can be solved by numerous methods, such as by using [submarine sends(https://libsubmarine.org/). User Experience Any user that uses a Dapp that is deployed to a layer 2 with an Optimistic Rollup construction can enjoy economic abstraction (eg: fee-free transactions, pay with ERC-20, etc.) and quasi-instant transactions (transactions in the ball-park of 200ms, don't blink or you'll miss it!). Pros/Cons Pros: Flexibility in generalized Computation (Turing-complete / EVM compatible) Increase in scalability (200 to 2000 transactions-per-second (tps) vs Ethereum layer 1's current 10 tps) All Data is available on-chain (no need to trust off-chain data providers) Better UX (as explained above) Cons: Limited Throughput when compared with some other Layer 2 solutions (Plasma, ZK Rollups, etc.) Some additional security issues are raised (discussed below) Demo A Uniswap-like exchange called Unipig was developed by both Uniswap and Plasma Group teams as a Proof of Concept application and demonstrated at Devcon5, which you can try for free at unipig.exchange .

The Raiden protocol aims to facilitate this market by using both protocol-level features and optional auxiliary services.","title":"The Raiden Network"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/payment-channels/#resources","text":"Raiden Network","title":"Resources"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/","text":"Plasma What is Plasma? Plasma is a layer-2 scaling solution that was originally proposed by Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin in their paper Plasma: Scalable Autonomous Smart Contracts . It is a framework for building scalable applications. Plasma uses a combination of smart contracts and cryptographic verification. Together, these enable fast and cheap transactions by offloading these transactions from the main Ethereum blockchain into a \"side\" chain (sometimes referred as child or plasma chains). These side chains periodically report back to the main chain and use it to settle any disputes (almost like a higher court). Why it is needed According to Vitalik Buterin, it is a \"bad idea\" to build sophisticated features into the base layer of the blockchain, it would create a high level of governance overhead as the platform would have to continually discuss, implement and coordinate newly discovered technical improvements. The time intensive task to add a new feature into the base protocol might cause Ethereum to stagnate. We should not only be relying on changes to the base protocol to continue progressing Ethereum. I do think that as blockchains become more and more mature, layer 1 will necessarily stabilize, and layer 2 will take on more and more of the burden of ongoing innovation and change. How does Plasma work? The Plasma structure is built through the use of smart contracts and Merkle trees, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of child chains - which are, essentially, smaller copies of the parent Ethereum blockchain. Each chain is designed to work in a singular way, serving different needs by coexisting and operating independently. On top of each child chain, more chains can be created and this is what builds a tree-like structure. Deposits and withdrawals of Plasma chain funds with state transitions is enabled by fraud proofs. This ensures enforceable state and exchangeability. It also allows the processing of a greater number of transactions with less data loading on the basic platform. Any user can send funds to another, including those from a different set of participants. These fund transfers can be paid and withdrawn in the native platform coin. Fraud Proofs The communication between the child chains and the root chain is secured by fraud proofs. Each child chain has its own mechanisms for validating blocks and a particular fraud-proof implementation, which can be built on top of different consensus algorithms. The most common are Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority. The fraud proofs ensure that in case of malicious activity, users are able to report dishonest nodes, protect their funds and exit the transaction (which involves an interaction with the main chain). In other words, fraud proofs are used as a mechanism through which a Plasma child chain files a complaint to its parent chain or to the root chain. These proofs use an interactive funds-withdrawal protocol. In order to withdraw a certain amount of funds, an exit time is needed. The exiting party must confirm the outputs via UTXO model requesting a withdrawal. Network participants can then submit a bonded proof that has to be confirmed and tested if any funds have been spent. If the event appears to be wrong, it is treated as fraudulent, and the confirmation is cancelled. With time, another bonded round allows the withdrawal to happen, bonding to state before a committed timestamp. An incorrect Plasma chain can be quickly exited by participants. In case of attack, participants can quickly exit and save their costs, ensuring security within the system. Example If Alice keeps 1 ETH in a Plasma chain, for instance, it gets recorded into a block, whereas the consensus is met due to fraud proofs. Further commitments are enforced and submitted on the base chain, and her funds are held in its smart contract: Plasma: Pros and Cons Undoubtedly, plasma is a good solution for scalability issues but Plasma does have some drawbacks. Each new plasma iteration reveals a new research problem that needs to be addressed, leading to multiple Plasma variants that navigate deployment trade-offs in different ways. We will compare these different variants in detail below but let's first compare the pros and cons of plasma and it's variants. Pros Cons Plasma will help the Ethereum blockchain scale by taking operations off-chain Plasma requires a centralized component in order to operate as the off-chain component is managed by authorities Lower fees and faster operations also enables computationally intensive applications to run on a blockchain Long waiting periods(7-14 days) for users who wish to withdraw their funds Eliminating significant amount of unnecessary data in the main chain which also reduces the processing bandwidth of nodes Poor experience for users who don\u2019t have a large number of assets and don\u2019t want to wait weeks to access them It is compatible with various on-chain scaling solutions such as sharding, varying block sizes, etc. New security risks/challenges (primarly for exits) that would need to be addressed to maintain immutability. Many plasma variants have their own set of drawbacks such as: Plasma MVP has time constraints, is a less than ideal user experience, and is vulnerable to network congestion. Plasma Cash relies on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to function which requires heavy transaction histories. You will have to keep track of the value and have to be constantly collecting proofs of non-inclusion, and so when you transfer ownership of the NFT you have to transfer its history as well. Exploring popular plasma flavours There isn\u2019t any single project called \"Plasma\". Instead, there are lots of different projects that use the tools provided by the Plasma framework/specification. Currently there are four main distinct versions of the protocol: Plasma Cash Plasma Cash is a Plasma design primarily built for storing and transferring non-fungible tokens. It is highly scalable because users only ever need to keep track of their own tokens. It uses Sparse Merkle Trees (SMT) for non inclusion proofs and hence can only be used for NFTs since SMTs uses indexing. Each block has a \u2018slot\u2019 for each coin (unique deposit). When a coin is spent, a transaction proof is recorded in that coin\u2019s respective slot in the block. Note: Coin defragmentation research to support FTs is going on currently Plasma Debit Plasma Debit is like Plasma Cash, except every token is a payment channel between the user and the chain operator. It\u2019s sort of like a big Lightning Network hub, but the channels can be transferred just like a Plasma Cash token. Transactions are super fast and you only need to keep track of your own channels. Plasma Prime Plasma Prime is a fancy new design that makes use of RSA accumulators to solve the problem of large history proofs in Plasma Cash. MVP (Minimum Viable Plasma) Plasma MVP is a design for an extremely simple UTXO-based Plasma chain. The basic Plasma MVP specification enables high-throughput payment transactions, but does not support more complicated constructions like scripts or smart contracts. Plasma MVP relies on confirmation signatures because withdrawals are processed in order based on the position of the output being withdrawn. Users need to sign a signature before making a transaction, wait to see the transaction included in a valid block, and then sign another signature. These second signatures must also be included within a plasma block, reducing block space available for more transactions! Note: Confirmation signatures make for pretty bad user experience. More Viable Plasma , also known as MoreVP , is an extension to Minimal Viable Plasma that removes the need for confirmation signatures. MoreVP modifies the process through which users can withdraw their funds. The ordering of each withdrawal becomes based on the position of the youngest input to the transaction that created an output.

State channels are a very broad and simple way to think about blockchain interactions which could occur on the blockchain, but instead get conducted off of the blockchain, without significantly increasing the risk of any participant. The most well known example of this strategy is the idea of payment channels in Bitcoin, which allow for instant fee-less payments to be sent directly between two parties. State channels are very similar to the concept of payment channels in Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, but instead of only supporting payments, they also support general \u2018state updates.\u2019 For example, moves conducted in a game of Chess could be updated in a state channel and only broadcasted to the Ethereum network once the game is finished. This allows ethereum applications to \"move\" transactions off-chain, increasing the usefulness of the network as a whole. Who is working on State Channels? Teams currently working on State Channels are: CelerX Connext Network * Counterfactual How do State Channels work? State channels work by \u201clocking up\u201d some portion of blockchain state into a multisig contract, controlled by a defined set of participants. The state that is \u201clocked up\u201d is called a state deposit. For instance, this might be an amount of ether or an ERC20 token, but could also be a cryptokitty or an ENS domain name. After the state deposit is locked, channel participants use off-chain messaging to exchange and sign valid ethereum transactions without deploying them to chain. These are transactions that could be put on chain anytime, but are not. A basic breakdown: Part of the blockchain state is locked via multisignature or some sort of smart contract, so that a specific set of participants must completely agree with each other to update it. Participants update the state amongst themselves by constructing and signing transactions that could be submitted to the blockchain, but instead are merely held onto for now. Each new update \u201ctrumps\u201d previous updates. Finally, participants submit the state back to the blockchain, which closes the state channel and unlocks the state again (usually in a different configuration than it started with). Since all exchanged transactions are equally valid as far as the blockchain is concerned, state channels need a mechanism to ensure that the latest off-chain state (i.e., the latest move in our chess game) is the one that ultimately gets settled on the main chain. Thus, if a party attempts to unilaterally close a channel, other parties in the channel have a period of time \u2014 a \"dispute window\" \u2014 in which they have an opportunity to submit a more recent state, thereby proving that fraud was attempted. Once an infraction is proven, the contract handles the resolution process, which typically involves punishing the guilty party by slashing their deposited funds (though one could also simply update to the valid state and proceed accordingly). If the \u201cstate\u201d being updated between participants was a digital currency balance, then we would have a payment channel. Steps 1 and 3, which open and close the channel, involve blockchain operations. But in step 2 an unlimited number of updates can be rapidly made without the need to involve the blockchain at all \u2014 and this is where the power of state channels comes into play, because only steps 1 and 3 need to be published to the network, pay fees, or wait for confirmations. In fact, with careful planning and design, state channels can remain open almost indefinitely, and be used as part of larger hub and spoke systems to power an entire economy or ecosystem. Difference between State Channels and Sidechains State Channel pros State channels have strong privacy properties: This is because everything is happening \u201cinside\u201d a channel between participants, rather than broadcast publicly and recorded on-chain. Only the opening and closing transactions must be public. Whereas in sidechains every transaction is published on the sidechain which is received by every participant on the sidechain irrespective of the fact that you are not interacting with all of the participants on the sidechain. State channels have instant finality, meaning that as soon as both parties sign a state update, it can be considered final. Both parties have a very high guarantee that, if necessary, they can \u201cenforce\u201d that state on-chain. State Channel cons State Channels need 100% availability of all the participants involved: As we have discussed above that if anyone the participants goes unavailable, then this could prove costly to him. The participants can use a third party service to represent him if he goes unavailable (see, for instance, http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/05/22/pisa/ ), but the possibility of the representative getting attacked or bribed makes it a problem for state channels. Whereas in sidechains you don\u2019t have to be available all the time you are on the sidechain. State channels are best used for applications with a defined set of participants: This is because the state deposit contract(the contract used to lock the state) must always know the participants/entities (i.e. addresses) that are part of a given channel. We can add and remove people, but it requires a change to the contract each time. Whereas in sidechains there is no such limitation on the movement of the participants. State Channels are particularly useful where participants are going to be exchanging many state updates over a long period of time: This is because there is an initial cost to creating a channel in deploying the state deposit contract. But once it is deployed, the cost per state update inside that channel is extremely low. Sidechain pros Sidechains are permanent. You don\u2019t have create your own sidechain for specific purpose if there is one present: Sidechains are created and maintained once made. We don\u2019t close sidechains, rather we lock the assets on sidechain to move back to the mainchain. This can be helpful in the way that anyone who is doing a specific task off blockchain/mainchain (for eg. transacting in dogecoin) will come to the same sidechain. So, you don\u2019t have to create separate chains for every new participant. Whereas in state channels, an on-chain operation is required to add a participant to an existing channel. But projects such as Raiden network, and more generally the technique of meta-channels, offer a partial solution to this. They create a mesh of participants so you don\u2019t have to create a new channel for every new participant you interact with. You can interact with participants indirectly creating a channel between you and recipient through some other participant who is common to both: you and the recipient. Sidechains allow cryptocurrencies to interact with one another: They add flexibility and allow developers to experiment with Beta releases of Altcoins or software updates before pushing them on to the main chain. Traditional banking functions like issuing and tracking ownership of shares can be tested on sidechains before moving them onto main chains. Sidechain cons Sidechains do not benefit from the security of the main-chain. A user interacting on a side-chain must trust the security properties of that sidechain, because if it compromised or malevolent, a user has no guarantee of withdrawal to the main-chain. In contrast, participants in a state channel can always return to the main-chain so long as they follow the protocol. Sidechains need a lot of initial investment to start off: To create a sidechain we need to have enough miners so that the network is safe from attackers. Also, we have to make sure that they are up and running. Whereas there is no blockchain involved in state channels. So, no such requirement is needed. A Federation is needed for sidechains: This adds another layer between the mainchain and the sidechain. This could prove as another weak point for the attackers to attack by bribing or attacking the federation. Whereas in state channel we just need a smart contract to do this for us.

We don\u2019t close sidechains, rather we lock the assets on sidechain to move back to the mainchain. This can be helpful in the way that anyone who is doing a specific task off blockchain/mainchain (for eg. transacting in dogecoin) will come to the same sidechain. So, you don\u2019t have to create separate chains for every new participant. Whereas in state channels, an on-chain operation is required to add a participant to an existing channel. But projects such as Raiden network, and more generally the technique of meta-channels, offer a partial solution to this. They create a mesh of participants so you don\u2019t have to create a new channel for every new participant you interact with. You can interact with participants indirectly creating a channel between you and recipient through some other participant who is common to both: you and the recipient. Sidechains allow cryptocurrencies to interact with one another: They add flexibility and allow developers to experiment with Beta releases of Altcoins or software updates before pushing them on to the main chain. Traditional banking functions like issuing and tracking ownership of shares can be tested on sidechains before moving them onto main chains.","title":"Sidechain pros"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/state-channels/#sidechain-cons","text":"Sidechains do not benefit from the security of the main-chain. A user interacting on a side-chain must trust the security properties of that sidechain, because if it compromised or malevolent, a user has no guarantee of withdrawal to the main-chain. In contrast, participants in a state channel can always return to the main-chain so long as they follow the protocol. Sidechains need a lot of initial investment to start off: To create a sidechain we need to have enough miners so that the network is safe from attackers. Also, we have to make sure that they are up and running. Whereas there is no blockchain involved in state channels. So, no such requirement is needed. A Federation is needed for sidechains: This adds another layer between the mainchain and the sidechain. This could prove as another weak point for the attackers to attack by bribing or attacking the federation. Whereas in state channel we just need a smart contract to do this for us.","title":"Sidechain cons"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/state-channels/#resources","text":"State Channels - an explanation Making Sense of Ethereum's Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (Josh Stark) Generalized State Channels on Ethereum (Jeff Coleman, Liam Horne, and Xuanji Li) State Channel Applications (Liam Horne)","title":"Resources"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/","text":"ZK-STARKs Summary ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) are a type of cryptographic proof technology that enables users to share validated data or perform computations with a third party without the data or computation being revealed to the third-party, also known as a zero-knowledge proof, in a way that is publicly verifiable. In simpler terms, a zero-knowledge proof can prove something is true without having to reveal what exactly it is proving. For example, ZK-STARKs would allow Alice to verify Bob's banking information using a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof instead of revealing the confidential information to Alice. Prior to the creation of ZK-STARKs, ZK-SNARKs were used to create ZK proof systems, but required a trusted party or parties to initially setup the ZK proof system which introduced the vulnerability of those trusted parties compromising the privacy of the entire system. ZK-STARKs improve upon this technology by removing the need for a trusted setup. Scaling benefits of using STARKs STARKs improve two of the problems of permissionless blockchains: scalability and privacy. The pioneer in STARK technology StarkWare Industries' current ZK-STARK research is focusing on scalability first and then privacy later on. STARKs improve scalability by allowing developers to move computations and storage off-chain. Off-chain services will be able to generate STARK proofs that attest the integrity of off-chain computations.

A: In phase 1 (about 2020 by my estimate) we will have shard data. Those shards, even without an EVM, can be used as the data availability layer for TrueBit (and other alternative execution engines). Phase 2 (about 2021) is when we will have scalable L1 execution. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: ELI5 execution engines Follow up A: An execution engine is a way to compute state assuming consensus on data. The execution engine for the EVM is \"naive re-execution\". There are more fancy execution engines such as TrueBit and SNARK/STARK-based validity proofs. [Justin Drake] Q: Are economists being consulted to help decide the issuance rate of a full POS system? Stated more broadly, who is helping/advising the ETH 2.0 team on the effects certain issuance decisions will have on the network and community (both in the short and long term)? A: Personally at this point the feedback I'm most interested in is actually feedback from potential stakers. The main question basically being, are there any other tweaks we can make to the economics that, given a fixed level of reward, will (i) encourage more people to validate, and (ii) encourage many small solo validators or smaller pools, as opposed to a few large pools. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Considering that Yoichi is not working anymore in the Foundation, what are your plans on formal verification of ETH 2.0 specs? A: I'd say that formal verification of the spec will make sense when the spec is more mature and stable, maybe mid 2019. Anyone interested in doing formal verification of the ETH 2.0 specs in a few months, please send a grant proposal. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the best response to a developer who is hesitant about building on ethereum today, given that it will be \"replaced\" by ETH 2.0 over the next few years? A: I expect that once the state and execution model for Serenity solidifies (see https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 for one minimal proposal) we'll start working with the developer community on modifications to high-level languages (Solidity, Vyper, etc) and best practices. Hopefully at that point it will become clearer how to build applications in such a way that they could be redeployed as-is on the 2.0 chain. At least that's my hope. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Building on Ethereum 1.0 today is great for learning and prototyping. It's also great for assembling a culturally-aligned team consistent with the philosophy of the Ethereum community (which may be different than the philosophy of the Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Tether, etc. communities). [Justin Drake] Q: Can we run multiple validator clients on a single machine assuming we've got multiple 32 Eth deposits? A: Yep! There's nothing preventing you from using one machine to run multiple validators. The only hard limit you'll face is that the number of shards you are assigned to validate increases linearly with the number of validator slots you have, so if you have thousands of ETH a laptop will not suffice and you'll need something more powerful. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Short answer: Yes. Long answer: You will need to register a validator for every 32 ETH. In phase 0 (just the beacon chain, no shards) you can likely handle thousands of validators on a single machine. After phase 1 the number of validators that can be operated on a single machine depends on how resourceful your machine is. A mainstream laptop should comfortably handle one validator, and likely handle 2-10 validators at max capacity. The computational resources scales linearly with the number of validators until you reach ~1,000 validators. At that point there are scalability advantages in being a super-node, i.e. a full node for every shard. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: How much importance are the devs placing on being able to run setups at home wrt keeping Ethereum decentralised and being able to move ETH in and out of staking pools? Follow up A: It's definitely a goal I care about. The alternative to staking at home is staking on AWS or staking through a pool, and both are risks for decentralization. Concrete ways we try to be friendly to staking at home: Relatively forgiving penalties for being offline, so you earn a net profit as long as you're online more than ~50-67% of the time Keeping the cost of validating the beacon chain low The anti-correlation penalty scheme, which more heavily penalizes validators that misbehave at the same time as many other validators (which is more likely if you're on the same pool or VPS or whatever). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: How can I help / get involved? I fell in love with Ethereum not too long ago. I\u2019ve been reading Zcash\u2019s BLS12-381 Elliptic Curves and for the past few days these are all thats been on my mind. I love this project now and just found ethresear.ch. I really wanna help in any way possible! Thanks again for all your hard work. I can\u2019t stop reading these posts. A: For researchers a good way to contribute and gain visibility is to post quality content on ethresear.ch. If you are a developer consider joining one of the numerous ETH2.0 implementation teams. [Justin Drake] A2: Hi! The best way to get involved is to find something that captures your interest and to dig in. Because Ethereum is a radically open platform, the research and development is also generally very open and very accessible. Keep reading. Follow your interests down all the little paths and begin to build a mental model of the ecosystem. https://ethresear.ch/ is a great place to follow and begin to contribute to research discussions. https://gitter.im/ethereum/sharding is where a lot of the day to day conversation about Serenity is happening (developers chatting from various projects) https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs Read the spec! but not only read it, be an active reader. If you find an error, typo, bug, etc, submit a PR. Also check out the issues and PRs in the spec repo. We are constantly discussing changes, fixes, updates and anyone can contribute. If you are a dev, open up one of the eth2.0 client projects and pick a \"good first issue\". These allow you to touch the codebase, contribute a bit, get the lay of the land, and provide the foundation to tackle bigger issues from there. ^ Those are Serenity specific suggestions, but beyond that, just find projects you are interested in and begin contributing. There is so much to do and project leads are always excited to have helping hands. This stuff doesn't build itself :) [Danny Ryan] A3: If you're interested in Cryptography especially, you can also check out another BLS - Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham signature spec for Serenity and help to review it: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/bls_signature.md :) For research, as Justin and Danny said, ethresear.ch is the sanctuary. And first, you can take a look the various topics on Ethereum Sharding Research Compendium to see which area you're most interested in. For implementation, there are multiple topics: Consensus layer - implement the spec! P2P layer design and implementation - see https://github.com/ethresearch/p2p [Hsiao-Wei Wang] Q: From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside. Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)? For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse. A: Cross-shard communication will definitely be slow at base layer, however there are higher-level mechanisms that can be used to implement fast cross-shard communication on top of a base layer that allows any cross-shard communication at all even if slow. See https://ethresear.ch/t/a-layer-2-computing-model-using-optimistic-state-roots/4481 for an example of how this could be done. In general, I expect a lot of the long-run innovation in improving the smart contract development experience to happen at higher levels in this way; I write about why this is a good idea at length here: https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What happens to all the contracts currently running? A: It is somewhat speculative at this point. My best guess is that Ethereum 1.0 contracts will stay running as-is for a long time (say, 10+ years) without any migration to Ethereum 2.0. This can be made sustainable by doing two things: Lower the inflation (e.g. reduce it by 20x, bringing the PoW security to a blockchain such as Ethereum Classic). Completely removing inflation\u2014relying on transaction fees only\u2014would also be possible (see below for security argument). Use Ethereum 2.0 to regularly finalise Ethereum 1.0, counter-balancing the reduced security and preventing long-range 51% attacks. This requires Ethereum 1.0 nodes to be beacon chain light clients, which should take years to happen. If the community gets tired of Ethereum 1.0 a bomb mechanism (e.g. difficulty bomb, issuance bomb, gas bomb, etc.) can gracefully kill it. Another possibility is for Ethereum 1.0 to become a contract on Ethereum 2.0. I don't see this as a practical solution, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise :) [Justin Drake] A follow up: I'll add that if any specific user wants to migrate their application to the 2.0 chain, then they should be able to just take their existing high-level code (Solidity or Vyper), make relatively few changes and redeploy. The main difference between the eth1 and eth2 systems that users will need to worry about is likely to be rent (or equivalents like gas-payment-extended bounded TTLs). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there a worry that shards will become \u201cgentrified\u201d until full shard interoperability? Basically, will one shard capture all the defi apps because they can't directly communicate with each other on separate shards? A: I would say if that happens, that will create a large incentive for someone to create a defi dapp that can interact with the other defi dapps through asynchronous cross-shard transactions and launch it on a cheaper shard. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: At the start in times of low usage, the economic load-balancing might result in over and under utilized shards. Overtime as usage increases, I expect the economic benefits of deploying and interacting on particular shards will become more tangible and result in a more economically rational distribution across shards. Observing the emergent behavior is going to be super fascinating :) [Danny Ryan] Q: Can we run the same validator on multiple machines - in order to avoid penalties if one machine was compromised ? If yes - what happens when we run a validator on 3 machines, one goes temporary offline, one is compromised, one is OK? A: For small amounts of ETH I'd recommend just running on one machine; unless many other validators get penalized at the same time as you, the penalties are not too large. If you do want to decentralize your validator, then we have recently made progress toward validation being more multi-party-computation friendly, which would allow you to run a validator as a 2-of-3. In that case, as long as two of the three sub-nodes are functioning correctly you'll be fine. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Yes! Ethereum 2.0 is friendly to n-of-m schemes thanks to BLS signatures. For example, with a 2-of-3 scheme you have can three computers, each with a share of the validator private key, such that two need to be online at any given time. This improves security as well, because an attacker now needs to compromise two of the BLS key shares. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there tech from any competitors such as Dfinity (or any others) that is worth adopting into Ethereum 2.0, or is the work all other dapp/smart contract platforms doing not relevant/good enough for ETH 2.0? A: Part of the job of the research team is to absorb good ideas from research papers and other blockchain projects. I keep a keen eye on technically interesting projects such as Dfinity, Coda, Zcash, etc. Competitors definitely also have good ideas, and learning from each other is part of the game :) [Justin Drake] Q: Do we need to run a full node to also earn from network fees or would the validator client handle this? A: Depends what you mean by \"full node\". The design of the sharding system is such that no one needs to run a node that verifies all of the data of all of the shards. A validator client validates the beacon chain and the specific shards that you get assigned to validate, and that is sufficient to earn network fees. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: The validator client should abstract the necessary tasks to get revenue from the different revenue streams. (This includes being a full node for the beacon chain and one shard at any given time, but that's a technicality you don't have to worry about.) [Justin Drake] Q: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. It's also the thing that scares me the most about the proposed design;i can see how they would really increase the security of the random sample selection process in addition to RANDAO but manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? A: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. We're working our way with various partners, including Synopsys, AWS, TSMC, GUC, etc. VDF announcements to come in February :) manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. Right. The good news is that Ethereum 2.0 can launch just fine without VDFs, so we're not betting Ethereum 2.0 on the success of VDFs. The current plan is to have VDF hardware ready in 2020, but 2021 would also be acceptable. From a financial perspective, we may share the total costs (estimated at $15m) with Filecoin and other projects interested in VDFs. We are already sharing costs with Filecoin on viability studies. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? Short answer: yes, of course :) Long answer: the ethresear.ch post provides a bit of clarity on that. highly specialized hw always connected providing a crucial function to the network it would be a prime target for potential adversaries to disrupt or compromise Right. The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to be online for normal operation, and even if everyone goes down it's not a huge deal. The main negative consequence is that dApps relying on unbiasable randomness will have to wait longer than expected for the random numbers to arrive. [Justin Drake] Q: zk-STARKs are powerful and I have been reading Eli\u2019s and the others paper on it. Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? I know Coda is planning on using Recursive zk-SNARKs to shrink chains but the lack of transparency is worrying. A: I don't see what fundamentally prevents them from happening. Recursive [any zero knowledge proof schemme] just means using the ZKP mechanism to make a ZKP of the ZKP's own verification procedure. The main challenge in practice is just that these verification procedures themselves have a high cost (eg. there's 50-500 kB worth of hashes in a STARK to verify), and this cost multiplied by the ZKP's overhead is quite a big number. ZK SNARK verification is in contrast much more \"concise\". [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? In theory yes, but as I understand recursive zk-STARKs won't make sense from a performance standpoint for most applications, at least in the medium term. [Justin Drake] Q: What\u2019s the final scalability limit of Ethereum post Serenity? Gas limits per block? Blocks per second? A: The current design has a fixed number of shards, at most one block per 6-second slot, and fixed block sizes. This means that the data bandwidth is capped. The gas limit on the other hand will likely be floating, just like Ethereum 1.0. [Justin Drake] A follow up: Though in the current phase 1 spec that's sitting around in draft mode the block size is so far fixed to 16 kB, as keeping it fixed makes the code for proofs of custody, data availability proofs, etc much simpler. If we want to bump up capacity later increasing the shard count may well be the simpler way to do it. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why should anyone move to the Beacon Chain? How exactly do you envision the move to happen? A: Why should anyone move to the beacon chain. Specifically, only validator balances exist in the Beacon Chain. User balances and state exist in the shard chains. Validators will move to the beacon chain to seek profit by providing security and resources to network. Note there is a new proposal to have the beacon chain finalize the PoW chain during the transition period so the validators would be able to provide security both to the new shards and the existing chain. Users will move to the shard chains to participate in the new scalable, sharded landscape. We envision economic activity to begin to move over as the system stabilizes and begins to show clear economic benefits to the users. It is important to note that a user could choose to not move until the eth1.0 state is rolled into a shard. How exactly do you envision the move to happen? At first, this will just be a single directional deposit for validators only to begin validation. Once the state execution layer is in the new 1024 shards, users will be able to transfer eth directly to the shards from the PoW chain. In the long term, the plan is to roll the PoW state into one of the shards. The current most favorable strategy from our perspective is to fork the PoW state root into a contract along with an EVM interpreter. Users could then execute txs on the existing eth1.0 state by call the contract along with the merkle witnesses of the state they need to access. This option is nice because it allows us to cleanly deprecate eth1.0 support in the long term. [Danny Ryan] A2: Moving to the beacon chain is done by sending ETH to a so-called \"deposit contract\" on Ethereum 1.0. People would send ETH to the beacon chain to become an Ethereum 2.0 validator and gain financial rewards. [Justin Drake] Q: How much funds does Ethereum foundation have and are these enough for finishing Eth 2.0? A: The EF has tens of millions of dollars in fiat, and a bunch of ETH. More than enough to finish ETH 2.0 :) [Justin Drake] Q: How is the status of a possibly fixed eth supply at some point in the future? Do you think it's likely? A: I don't know about fixed ETH supply, but we may get to a point of decreasing ETH supply. Indeed, we are looking into transaction fee schemes that burn ETH, and burnt ETH may outweigh minted ETH. [Justin Drake] Q: Have you looked into hyraxZK. They are zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup. Any thoughts on them being used in the future as the sizes are still very small. The only thing is they wouldnt be Quantum-Resistant but the proof size won\u2019t be similar to a zk-STARK. I wonder what they can be used for offchain as well, especially in networking by producing a zk proof of incoming packets that acts as Natural DDOS Protection. Just some thoughts. A: Have not looked into Hyrax specifically, but I am totally not surprised that things like it exist. I'm definitely very happy with the progress the general-purpose ZKP space has accomplished in the last few years; the very concept of general-purpose ZKP is pretty godlike compared to what I imagined was possible with cryptography as a child. Our general instinct is to find ways to make it possible to get the benefits of many different ZKP schemes with different tradeoffs in ethereum. The simplest way to do this would be to encourage the development of such tech as application-layer or network-layer addons so that it we do not need an agreement at consensus layer about a single ZKP scheme that everyone uses. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: V said that there are no fundamental problems left to solve. Is this true for only phase 0? If so, how confident are you about the other phases? A: Personally I am confident in all of the current fundamental technologies for all the phases outlined so far (Casper FFG and CBC, sharding, erasure coded data availability proofs, proofs of custody, receipt-based async transactions, layer 2 for acceleration, abstraction, rent, \"stateless client\" verification). There is definitely still a lot of room around the edges for optimization though. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why was Hybrid Casper ditched when it looks like the Beacon Chain kind of has nothing to do with the PoW chain? or Why not re-instate Hybrid Casper considering its testing is/was finalized? A: Honestly hybrid Casper is a bit of a dead end. Actually implementing/testing it across all the clients would require setting up a lot of infrastructure that we would then need to throw away. The design was highly inefficient because of its \"implemented-in-EVM\" nature, and it turned out that we could not really benefit from the ease-of-implementability of being done in EVM because we would need to write a lot of special-purpose code to make verification of signatures parallelizable. So we chose the route that would be somewhat more painful in the short term, but significantly lower headache to actually get to a stable sharded system overall. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: I wrote up some notes on the deprecation of EIP 1011 here https://notes.ethereum.org/s/rJDrKoBOQ [Danny Ryan] Q: 1. Since it is a one way transfer to the beacon chain, my understanding is that there will be two tokens: ETH1.0 and ETH2.0. Right? Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? Gutfeeling: how much \"unsolved computer science problems\" for phase 1, 2 and 3 roughly? I understood for phase zero it has arrived at 0. Will we consider some kind of tax baked into the system to ensure sustainability of core developments and infrastructure? A: Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? ETH in the beacon chain would not be transferable (anywhere!) until phase 2. That will make exchanges harder, although we may see a futures' market. My guess is that we will see 1 ETH ~ 1 BETH at pretty much all times :) [Justin Drake] My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? The reward/penalty constants are certainly not yet finalized and could use more community debate and input. That said, the rate does scale depending on the number of validators participating. If the fair market rate is really 20%, then a lower number of validators will show up. If the fair rate is 2%, then a ton of validators will show up. The economics of staking will find the natural equilibrium. That said the main risk here is if we set the target rate too low and the equilibrium lands at a low participation rate (and thus low security of the network). Although ~2% (@ 10M eth validating) is not set in stone, the idea for a low rate is that a huge amount of ETH is already being held as a speculative asset. Any marginal rate of return on top of this already intended long-term hodling is a gain for the hodler. [Danny Ryan] Q: How would you (and or service providers) ensure the eth on the Beacon Chain is the same as that on the PoW chain and vice versa? A: Arbitrage is always possible in one direction by buying 1 BETH for 1 ETH. A key design goal of Ethereum 2.0 is full fungibility for ETH tokens between the Ethereum 1.0 chain, the beacon chain, and the shards. Two-way transfers between the beacon chain and the shards, as well as between shards, should come in phase 2. [Justin Drake] Follow up point: If you wait until phase 2 for two-way flow, you privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money. This will be great for those few (probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. Follow up A: y ou privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money The ultimate loyalty test :) probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. We do have a minimum amount at stake to launch phase 0, around 214 * 32 ETH = 524,288 ETH. So we're effectively capping the interest rate (will be less than 25%) and setting a minimum security level. [Justin Drake] Q: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? A: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? At least as long as you are a validator. Withdrawal times should be a few days/weeks/months depending on how many other validators are trying to withdraw. What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? You can switch machines. You need a copy of your private keys in case your machine gets destroyed or stolen. Another thing is the withdrawal key used for withdrawals only. Keep that one in cold storage ideally. [Justin Drake] Q: Contributing to Ethereum 2.0? Are there any projects which are some sort of \"under water\", like only few people working on it. A: I feel at this point there are enough implementation teams, at least compared to some of the other issues that are underaddressed. Off the top of my head: Solidity being compile-able to E-WASM Vyper being compile-able to E-WASM Thinking about research problems related to phase 2, particularly around account abstraction, asynchronous contract programming models, etc Privacy, eg. see https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-we-should-value-privacy-more/2475 Improving the state of decentralized messaging and file storage [Vitalik Buterin] Follow up A: A few more things good to work on: liibp2p implementations in various languages Doing security reviews of the spec prototyping account and state execution in eWASM a lot of work in cross client testing coming up in the next couple of months [Danny Ryan] Q: We have experienced consecutive delays with Constantinople due to bugs found late in the process on a comparatively low risk / simple upgrade. What work is being done to mitigate this on Phase 0 and 1 given how much more complex these implementations will be? (I.e. What testing, third party audits, other considerations are being taken to ensure seamless implementation/integration? A: As the phase 0 spec is moving into a more stable place, we are beginning to look into explicitly bringing in third party audits, academics, and formal analysis. In addition to this, we are currently laying down the foundations of cross client testing and fuzzing akin to eth1.0. You're correct in that the consensus/system layer of eth2.0 is much more complex than the single PoW chain so we are constantly trying to reduce complexity and simplify. This is a major engineering effort that will require many parties other than our research team to plan, build, test, execute, and maintain. I think it is a major strength that so many independent teams with a diverse set of expertise have stepped up to contribute. Note, one of the design goals in the spec readme -- \"to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency\" We're excited to see new efforts like the \"Ethereum Cat Herders\" and scheduled release cycles emerging in 1.0 and plan to incorporate any best practices and efforts into the 2.0 process. DePM (decentralized project management) is hard, but we continue to learn and continue to get better. [Danny Ryan] Q: How difficult will it be for 1.0 contracts to work on Serenity? Should developers expect to rewrite their contracts to account for state rent and cross-shard communication? A: Solidity can already compile to WASM and I believe it is in Vyper's roadmap to do so as well. These naive compilations might be inefficient (e.g. keeping 256 bit types in the 64bit wasm machine) so some amount of rewrite or utilization of optimizers might be called for. Beyond that, there are some unknowns that might change the approach to certain contract programming modesl. For example, storage fees might call for a new ERC20 contract design in which user balances are stored in separate child contracts so that users become responsible for managing their own storage fees related to their coins. [Danny Ryan] Q: What is the latest view on how the \"upgrade\" to Ethereum 2.0 will happen? Can you take us through the different phases/hardforks that will in the end enable the full PoS/sharded/WASM blockchain, and what each will enable? A: Eth2.0 is broadly divided into three phases -- Phase 0, 1, and 2. Phase 0 - The Beacon Chain This phase is the launch of the core system level functionality of the new PoS chain (the beacon chain). Validators can submit deposits, join the validator set, and build/finalize the core chain. At this point the chain will have Casper finality, an RNG, shuffling into the various validator roles, and simulate crosslinking in the (currently) non-existent shard chains. Phase 1 - Shard Chains (data) This phase is the launch of the shard chains, but only as a blockchain of data. (Execution and state comes in phase 2). At this point, validators will additionally build these data chains and finalize the each shard back into the beacon chain via \"crosslinks\" and attest the availability of the data. These crosslinks were already being created in Phase 0, but had a stub for the shard hash being finalized. In this phase, that hash becomes \"unstubbed\". Shard data chains begin to have some utility for applications that need a high availability data store. Phase 2 - Shard Chains (state and execution) This phase is the launch of state and execution of state (eWASM) on the shard chains. This is when users and applications will begin to migrate to Serenity and use it to it's full potential. Cross shard txs will be available at this point, and users can begin developing any number of \"layer 2\" execution engines on top. The above (especially phase 2) might be divided into sub-forks, and there will be a fork during/after phase 2 to bring in the eth1.0 state/evm into a contract. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm quoting James' article: \"This means there will be little reason to migrate smart contract code or users until Phase 4 is released, potentially in the mid-2020s\". Does this mean, ETH2.0 wont be usable before 2025? \"ETH2.0 designers do not know what the cross-shard communication system will look like.\" If you're so unsure about the features of ETH2.0, why is it being developed at all? What will be the advantages in daily use compared to EHT1.X? Why should anyone wait till \"the mid-2020s\" to use ETH2.0? A: 2025 sounds... unlikely! I publicly made the prediction (since July 2018) that phases 0, 1, 2 will come in 2019, 2020, 2021 respectively. Scaling from shards will come in phase 1 and phase 2. On the topic of timelines, for phase 0 specifically, ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses for phase 0. [Justin Drake] A2: I answered a related question here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeufhqb [Danny Ryan] Q: https://hackernoon.com/what-to-expect-when-eths-expecting-80cb4951afcd From the article above, this is what I understand as the timeline of Ethereum 2.0: Phase 0 will be available in year 2020 Phase 1 will be available in 2022 Phase 2 will be available in 2023/24 Given the above timeline, is it fair to say that DAPP's have to wait at least 4 years before they can run their smart contracts on top of Ethereum 2.0? A: Hi! That article is written by an independent engineer that has been following development so it is not necessarily our 1-to-1 opinion. That said, I'm only seeing the following in the article -- \"Which is to say, while ETH2.0 may launch this year, don\u2019t expect ETH2.0 to support asset transfer or smart contracts until at least 2020.\" I agree that assets and smart contracts won't be available in eth2.0 in 2019. At the latest, I expect phase 2 to launch in 2021, but we are building a complex system and can't say for sure what unexpected challenges might arise between now and then. Waiting until 2023/24 is entirely out of the question for phase 2 imo. [Danny Ryan] Q: With eWASM will we be able to write contracts in Rust and/or any language that compiles to WASM in addition to Solidity? Where can one find out more about that and/or potentially help out? Thanks :) A: Yes you will be able to write contracts in any language that compiles to WASM :) I expect specific toolkits/frameworks to spring up in the languages people are particularly interested in (e.g. Rust, go, typescript, etc) to aid in writing contracts in these languages. https://github.com/ewasm/design is a great place to get started. The eWASM team has compiled a ton of info here to understand the project from a high level. https://gitter.im/ewasm/Lobby The eWASM team and broader community congregate in this gitter room and I'm sure would be willing to provide more guidance and answer any questions you have. [Danny Ryan] Q: Hi guys, Would you like to implement an optional decentralized identity layer in the future? like an option to use DID's or something. so the user can use zero knowledge proofs for Dapps that requires some proof of credentials of the user. Greetz A: Decentralized identity systems are definitely very interesting, but imo out-of-scope for blockchain base layers. The good news is that it's a Turing-complete platform, so anyone can build one on top of ethereum (1.0 or 2.0), and yes that are teams working on different approaches to it already. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What is the one thing on eth 2.0 dev that keeps you up at night? A: In my mind the Ethereum 2.0 abstract design is a remarkably elegant/slick/simple design. I worry that we botch the spec with poor taste in some of the implementation details, or bugs that we miss. [Justin Drake] Q: How will the Eth1.0/PoW chain eventually be migrated over? A: See the bottom of this post https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeucd4f tldr, fork into a stateless contract on a shard [Danny Ryan] A2: See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ [Justin Drake] Q: What are the current incentives for a person to run their own beacon node? A: It is a similar set of incentives as why you would run an eth1.0 node -- mining, run applications (block explorer, wallet services, dapp portal, etc), hobbyists wanting direct connection to the network, etc. If you are a validator, you will receive rewards for operating a node and signing consensus messages. If you run some sort of application, it can be beneficial to run a beacon chain to directly sync the shards you need. You also might serve light clients and applications as a business. I fully expect some some entities to experiment with this model. If you are a hobbyist, you might just like running the protocol directly for self-sovereignty :) [Danny Ryan] A2: Financial rewards through ETH inflation. I think Eric Conner has a spreadsheet somewhere. See https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1070713152864583682 for example here\u2014numbers presented here likely on the low side. [Justin Drake] Q: How do the researchers and developers feel about the complexity of ETH 2.0? A: We're definitely trying hard to bring the complexity down! Examples of complexity decreases that we've made in the last ~3 months include: Switching FFG from the \"per-block finalization\" model to a simpler epoch-based model Moving shard committee calculation outside the state Replacing the RANDAO hash onion construction with a simpler BLS construction (and same with the hash onion for proofs of custody) Storing validator state change slots in the validator record, making each validator's state transition process much more understandable Making shard blocks fixed size rather than variable size (which allows removing a lot of boilerplate for handling transitions) That said we recognize that there's still a way to go, and many features of eth2 don't feel neat and clean the way eg. Nakamoto PoW does. I personally hope a medium-term switch to Casper CBC (see https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/12/05/cbc_casper.html ) can mitigate some of that. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there any work being done on reducing the size of the blockchain as it grows? A: You mean the current chain or the 2.0 chain? Since this AMA is primarily about on the 2.0 chain I'll focus on that. The beacon chain state size is bounded, and there are no objects that hang around forever; even validator records disappear once either their balance drops too low or the validators exit voluntarily and then the withdrawal and exit waiting periods pass. On the shard chains, we're looking at ongoing storage maintenance fees for every byte of storage, \"hibernating\" accounts that do not pay up (at which point their users are responsible for storing and maintaining the data needed to revive those accounts if they need them). [Vitalik Buterin] A2: If you are talking about the Ethereum 1.0 chain size there are a number of workgroups in place and some of them deal with decreasing the chain state or slowing down chain state growth. See: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-ring-to-discuss-and-coordinate-all-ethereum-1x-efforts/2048 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-1-dot-x-a-half-baked-roadmap-for-mainnet-improvements/1995 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/state-rent-proposal-version-2-rushed/2494 [Hudson Jameson] Q: Inter-shard transactions - how do downstream shards protect themselves against kiting exploits (A- B B- C C- D where the transfer A- B is later challenged)?? I can imagine kiting tumblers that might make this a computationally intractable challenge. A: There isn't really a concept of \"challenging transfers\" in the current spec, and if you mean plain old fraud proofs then the answer is that if a block that was confirmed into a history turns out to be invalid then the entire history from that point on is invalid and should get discarded. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: If I deploy a contract in ETH 2.0 will it randomly be assigned to a shard? A: No. You specify the shard you want. You'll chose based on proximity to contracts of interest, and gas prices. (Each shard will have a separate gas market.) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though initial choice is not necessarily irreversible; contracts could be designed to be yanked ( https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-contract-yanking/1450 ) from one shard to another, and I expect a lot of applications will take advantage of this feature. Q: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? Also, will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? A: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? A software implementation of the VDF would likely be useless for production. The current estimate is that a CPU implementation would be 1,000 to 10,000 times slower than the ASIC. A software implementation would be useful for testing though. will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? There will be a small incentive for validators to also be VDF evaluators. Other than that we're mostly drawing from external incentives (e.g. as a large ETH holder you have an incentive that Ethereum stays healthy). The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to do its job. There will be thousands of VDF rigs given for free to the community. [Justin Drake] Q: Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds and can they cause collisions with old contracts? A: One of the features of Ethereum 2.0 is \"abstraction\", which means that users can specify whatever signature scheme they want. I expect quantum-secure signature schemes to gradually become more popular. Burn addresses can easily be made quantum-secure. Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds Yes, definitely a threat. Ownerless legacy address could be a systemic risk for blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Would be interesting to guestimate how much ETH is at risk. Q: ERC20/721 standards' design sucks. Is there any idea or plan to convert current tokens to ERC-1155 like, efficient format? (Code isn't Law. Seriously.) A: I'm hoping that Ethereum 2.0 standards (such as token standards) can learn from the mistakes of Ethereum 1.0 and evolve. Starting from scratch is a unique opportunity in Ethereum's lifetime. [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Agree! There's a lot from ERC20 that I dislike, the main two things being: It being a pull system vs a push system, requiring the whole approve/transferFrom mess to use tokens to pay for things in smart contracts Handling of ETH being so different from handling of tokens Definitely would like to see both issues resolved in 2.0. The other big things I want to \"get right this time\" is (i) multisig wallets and (ii) not having the \"ether used to pay for gas to withdraw funds from a mixer contract being a deanonymization vector\" issue that makes privacy hard at the moment. Q: How soon will staking pools be live when Ethereum staking goes live? A: At the consensus layer we are trying hard to be friendly to decentralised staking pools. Hopefully we will see those soon after the launch of phase 0. The research and implementation work that Dfinity is doing regarding BLS Distributed Key Generation (DKG) will likely help decentralised pools. Centralised staking pools\u2014unlike centralised mining pools\u2014are somewhat awkward because you have to trust the operator to behave properly with your funds. [Justin Drake] Q: If we want to bring our smart contracts to a new chain, could we pre-determine the corresponding starting/ending hex values for the old smart contracts? Kind of reminds me of CREATE2... A: Yes, Eth2.0 will have a CREATE2 equivalent for deploying contracts. As for existing contracts, the entire eth1.0 state will be rolled into a contract on a shard and these existing contracts will be callable via calling into this 1.0 contract targeting the existing contract address. [Danny Ryan] Q: Are there any courses or subjects in uni that one should take to help in becoming a researcher? A: I'd say you need to be a good self-learner. Math, cryptography, computer science, programming, economics, networking are all relevant. [Justin Drake] Q: Of proposed ways to tackle state rent problem, which one is your favorite? What do you think about resulting complexity from user point of view? A: As far as base protocol goes, either option here: https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 The complexity is actually not so much in the rent itself, it's in how it changes the developer experience. The general approach is that application storage will need to be more \"modular\" and explicitly broken down into chunks associated with specific users, possibly with a fixed amount of \"global\" storage, plus some short-term storage not assigned to any user that goes away after some fixed amount of time, eg. 6 months. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Question for Justin Drake and other VDF researchers: Would using Chainlink and TEEs (Intel SGX) be a viable method of generating secure randomness for the VDF function of Eth 2.0? Could this be used in lieu of specialized hardware? If so, I imagine this could be a substantial time and cost saving measure in the quest for Serenity. A: TEEs can be used to generate randomness using delay. Unfortunately TEEs is trusted hardware. We need a trustless solution :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though I would add that trusted hardware could be a great thing for individual validators to use to increase their security. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What computer science problems still need to be solved prior to the release of Phase 1? A: For phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. Please message me if that sounds like your cup of tea :) [Justin Drake] Q: What happens to the beacon chain in the event of a controversial hardfork on the Eth 1.0 chain? Will two beacon chains form? If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? How will this affect the transition of the Eth 1.0 chain onto a Eth 2.0 shard? What safeguards are in place to ensure that malicious participants do not create unnecessary volatility between ETH BETH during the year long transition from phase 0 to phase 2? It is my view that this trading pair must remain stable for a successful transition to take place. A: If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? By default the beacon chain validators will just use the voting mechanism that's specified in the spec, and whichever chain a majority of the validators support is the chain that the beacon chain will go with. That said, if we want to facilitate a peaceful split, there is a fork versioning feature built in to the beacon chain to make replay protection very easy... [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why are you not doing \"proper\" research and submit publications to conferences? A: Not really an answer to your question, but Ethresear.ch ( https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en as_sdt=0%2C5 q=\"ethresear.ch\" btnG= oq=\"et ) does get cited :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: As does the Casper FFG paper! [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Let's say that I have some ethereum locked on a time locked contract, will be available after the 2.0 transition? This question can be expanded to all 1.0 contract functionality after the POS transition A: The Ethereum 1.0 will live on, even after Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. See https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ . [Justin Drake] Q: Thoughts on this tweet? https://twitter.com/zaoyang/status/1088001513459511296?s=21 A: Eth 2.0 is not really trying to maintain backwards compatibility; almost every part of the design is significantly altered, and old contracts will have to explicitly migrate over to the new system and in some cases rewrite eg. to adapt to rent. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What's your vision for Eth 3.0? A: STARKs, STARKs and lots of STARKs. Hopefully some nice way to achieve 2 second average block times. Extremely effective cross-shard communication, either at base layer or through a variety of easy-to-use layer 2 systems. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: See https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1072593728253104128 [Justin Drake] Q: In the future how will a really popular DAPP operate? Will it be possible for a single DAPP to operate across multiple shards? If not how will it operate properly with the TX/sec limits on a single shard? Will L2 solutions be the only option? A: A dApp would have to get really big to consume all the resources in a given shard to justify spreading itself over multiple shards. For example, Uber does less than 20 rides per second. A similarly popular decentralised equivalent would likely fit on a single shard, especially when fancy L2 infrastructure is involved (e.g. state channels, plasma, SNARKs/STARKs). [Justin Drake] Q: What is your take on the current state of finding consensus on randomness, in particular the current VDF construction. While certainly clever, I wouldn't say it is very elegant. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? More general, are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) A: I wouldn't say it is very elegant I'd say VDFs are a super elegant thin layer on top of RANDAO :) Is it the hardware you don't like? If so, would you agree that proof-of-work is an elegant solution? Then think of VDFs as being \"proof-of-work 2.0\": much better randomness at much lower cost. It's a paradigm shift from massively-parallel work to inherently-sequential work. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? I'm not aware of any unbiasable randomness schemes that only have strong liveness, other than VDFs :) are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) We will have an academic \"VDF day\" at Stanford on Feb 3 to work on open problems. Will you be nearby? [Justin Drake] Q: Shouldn't the smart contract stated in (4) have the ability of sending just 16 ETH for something as RocketPool v2 work (while some consider this to be \"centralization\" I think it will help a lot the average user and mitigate the risk of the average user)? A: You can send between 1 ETH and 32 ETH to the Ethereum 1.0 deposit contract at any time. A minimum balance of 32 ETH on the beacon chain is required for activation as a validator. [Justin Drake] Q: I see a lot of people talking about nodes running in cloud. Shouldn't ETH find a way to actually discourage this? If everybody is running nodes in cloud that means we have possible single point of failure, which is against what I think we are trying to achieve and what enterprise customers are looking to eliminate. A: \"Partial slashing\" and the quadratic leak during times of no-finality actually financially encourage diverse validator setups. Your potential losses are much smaller when your slashable message or validator down-time are discorrelated. Diversity in setup includes -- node software, validation software, local server vs cloud provider (and which cloud if using cloud), geographic region, etc. If a ton of validators all run on AWS and AWS goes down, these validators will suffer large penalty leaks. To guard against this, I should setup my validation node locally or on a less used cloud provider. [Danny Ryan] A2: We do have a way! It's called \"partial slashing\" and the idea is that, if something goes wrong, the more people did something wrong the more everyone gets penalised. So there is an incentive to avoid correlation with other validators, and hence avoid centralisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Can you foresee ever having to move Eth 1.0 to Eth 2.0 in order to avoid losing it forever? A: The current plan is to incorporate the eth1.0 state into a contract on a shard in eth2.0. Note that this will just be a state root and an EVM interpreter along with eth balances. Users will be able to call into this contract by providing merkle witnesses of the required state. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm a new developer looking into Ethereum, where would you officially recommend I look to develop with an eye toward future proofing? A: A key consideration to future proof your contract code for Ethereum 2.0 is sustainable storage. It's known as \"storage rent\" and \"storage maintenance fees\". [Justin Drake] Q: What do you guys think of the Avalanche consensus mechanism and could it play a role in the ETH roadmap further into the future? A: Avalanche is interesting to me because it's a fresh approach. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out with Bitcoin Cash. Successes there can be ported to Ethereum via L2 infrastructure. [Justin Drake] Q: Is sharding smart contracts theoretically possible? How would one go about that? A: Here's a trivial example: the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be sharded across n shards according to the first log_2(n) bits in the domain name hash. [Justin Drake] Q: How does eth 2.0 balance security across shards holding different amounts of notional value in them? For example if there is a decentralized finance shard holding a very high % of eth + other tokens, would the stakers/validators responsible for that shard have incentives to behave badly? A: The key security guarantee of sharding comes from frequently shuffling validators into randomly-sampled committees (known as \"crosslink committees\"). The hope is that this fast shuffling resists bribing attacks, in both the \"honest majority\" and the \"slowly-adaptive rational majority\" security models. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: It still seems like an inefficiency where you'd be over-securing shards with low notional value + under-securing shards with high notional value. Am I thinking about this wrong? A: Every shard gets security with the same notional value. Value (validator collateral) gets spread evenly across shards. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: Ah think we are speaking past each other a bit, let me try to clarify my concern -- It seems likely you will have wildly varying ratios of (value sitting atop a particular shard / validator collateral securing that shard). So for example a defi shard with 90% of value in eth economy sitting in it only gets 1/1024th of the validator collateral securing it. And an empty or unused shard would get same 1/1024th of total validator collateral securing it. This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? A: This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? Oh I see! Interesting point. We consider every shard equal, and provide high security for all shards. The breakdown of even a single shard (namely, an unavailable or invalid crosslink) would likely be catastrophic for the whole system. [Justin Drake] Q: Will the Beacon Chain require its own nodes? Is this basically a brand new chain that has only one connection to ethereum: Proof of Burn? A: The beacon chain is a new system level chain that houses the validators and manages their responsibilities and rewards/penalties. In many ways this is akin to the FFG contract and sharding contract proposals that were previously deprecated but the organization breaks clean from the EVM to allow for a radically new design and increased efficiency. A node in the future can run the PoW chain and/or the beacon chain. If they run the beacon chain, they can then sync whatever shard chains they want. The connection at first is just an economic connection -- use the existing economics and community to seed validation in the beacon chain. Beyond that, we expect the beacon chain to be used to finalize the pow chain in the short to medium term. In the end, there are a number of proposals to either fork the eth1.0 state into eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: How does Eth 2.0 account for DDOS attacks? If people run nodes at home on consumer hardware with a normal internet connection they can be taken offline easily with DDOS attacks or am I interpreting this wrong? A: It is the responsibility of a validator to remain online to fulfill their responsibilities and gain rewards. A validator can remain profitable if they generally remain online greater than 50-67% of the time. A validator's inactivity penalties are also minimized if their being offline is dis-correlated from other validators. This incentivizes to utilize different node and validation software from the majority so that in the case of a ddos attack vector against a particular node implementation, your offline losses are minimized. The validator's protocol level identity and it's node's network identity are completely decoupled. This allows for a validator to create any type of obfuscated network setup that serves their purposes. I expect many tools and best practices to arise for home validators in the coming months. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are your thoughts on formal verification of smart contracts? Will this be possible with Ethereum 2.0? A: Formal verification of smart contracts is awesome and super valuable IMO. Formal verification will be possible in eth2.0. I believe the WASM semantics are already available in K which will provide some good opportunities for contract verification. Opening up more languages by using WASM will also allow for utilization of more restricted languages that are more amenable to FV. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are some good cypherpunk books that you would recommend to people getting interested in this space? (Or just good book recommendations in general) A: I don't read many books nowadays. I mostly consume academic papers, whitepapers, podcasts, videos, blog posts, Reddit, Twitter, etc. I did enjoy \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel when I was an entrepreneur. [Justin Drake] **Q: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? How are you solving the fast state syncing problem if nodes need to be reshuffled around shards? A: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? By randomly shuffling validators across shards. Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? Right now crosslink committees are shuffled every epoch (6.4 minutes) and shard proposer committees are shuffled every ~9 days. Crosslink committees are critical, hence why there are shuffled fast. See this answer also. [Justin Drake] Q: You said in a comment some days ago that there are basically no unsolved problems of Serenity Phase 0 left. Which problems of Phase 1 and 2 are still left to be solved? A: The short answer is there are no big fundamental problems for phases 0, 1, 2. The more detailed answer is that for phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. For phase 2 we need to figure out sustainable storage. [Justin Drake] Q: Before Eth 2.0 Enhancements come in, what is the best recommended approach for storing private data on Ehereum? A: Storing data on Ethereum is expensive per byte. Infrastructure like Filecoin may prove to be a good trustless storage solution. For privacy, just encrypt the data. [Justin Drake] Q: Will there be any zk-snarks related enhancements coming with Eth 2.0? A: We are hoping to have a SNARK- and STARK-friendly hash function in Ethereum 2.0 at some point. Unfortunately those likely won't be ready for phase 0. At the application layer, WASM will ideally mean that SNARK-specific precompiles won't be necessary. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there some kind of roadmap for the migration from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 in layman's terms? For true decentralization it is required to get more people on board that understand the full process. A: I described the three phases here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeueuzc EthHub also does a great job at simply describing the path https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/ [Danny Ryan] Q: ETH token will not be transferable back after migration to ETH2.0 What will be the token ticker for the ETH2.0 chain native token? A: ETH\u2014at least when Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. Fungibility is a key design goal. [Justin Drake] Q: Where does new client software take lists of peers with their ip addresses and ports? Is there is centralized server? A: This is an implementation detail. Some clients may have a hardcoded list of \"bootstrap node\" IPs and ports. [Justin Drake] **Q: Do you have any final plans in mind about the current ETH inflation? A: Nothing final. Ultimately the community will have to make a tradeoff between low inflation and high security. See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 . [Justin Drake] Q: What are the odds that a fully sharded chain including state transitions is feasible? A: Very high. No fundamental problems unsolved. The tricky part is getting everything to fit together cleanly. [Danny Ryan] Q: Can I use a raspberry Pi to stake when staking is possible? And what do I do with it in the mean time? A: Nimbus ( https://github.com/status-im/nimbus ) is targeting resource-constrained validators :) [Justin Drake] Q: What's your opinion of EOS (or TRON, STEEM) in terms of dapp platform? A: I tend to be critical of that class of systems. See https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html and https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html for reasons why. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Any updates as far as overall inflation rate per year or per milestone/HF? Any updates as far as TPS per year or per milestone/HF? A: See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 [Justin Drake] Q: Can I make a Zcash coin on ETH 2.0 for example with all or most of the advantages of Zcash? A: Yes, there are already a number of experiments in eth1.0 to demonstrate usage of ZKSNARKs for both privacy and scalability. Check out miximus for privacy and roll up for scalability (both by barry whitehat!). Usage of ZKSNARKs will be supported in eWASM state execution so I expect more privacy solutions akin to Zcash to continue to be built on eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: Why is ETH 2.0 Phase 0 even needed as a \"main\" chain, and need Bether transform from real ether (hence risk losing some value), instead of doing a testnet only, because after all this is what phase 0 is, based on TestnetBEther? A: ETH 2.0 needs a main chain as a single point of truth for all the shards. The reason we have phases 0, 1, 2 is to break things down conceptually, and in terms of incremental releases to limit risk. [Justin Drake] Q: What work is being done to make the research behind ETH 2.0 more geographically decentralized? Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? A: Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? Once the spec is more mature I expect the community to pick this up, somewhat similar to how Andreas's books get translated. English seems to be the a lingua franca for research and development. [Justin Drake] Q: After PoS, if a node gets hacked, can the hacker make the node to lose its stake by confirming false transactions? A: When your validator gets penalised it is automatically deregistered to prevent further damage. We have a mechanism called \"partial slashing\". The idea is that, if something goes wrong with your validator it only gets penalised a bit if not many other validators also mess up around that time. So in the optimistic case of a lone hack you should recover most of your funds with your withdrawal key (kept secure, e.g. in cold storage). [Justin Drake] Q: Will contracts be able to pay for gas in Eth 2.0? A: That will likely be unlocked with abstraction (which includes gas abstraction). [Justin Drake] Q: Assuming the number of network nodes remains the same and the network graduates to full PoS... what is your expected maximum theoretical transaction throughout? A: Rough ballpark figures. 1024 shards * 10 transactions per second per shard ~= 10k transactions per second. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the most updated timeline for rolling out PoS? Since Vitalik already said 'research is done', what are developers' incentives to push things forward? Are there any specific measures taken to ensure a smooth transition? A: I expect the beacon chain (the core PoS chain) to launch late 2019. Ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses. Having the Ethereum 2.0 chain finalise the Ethereum 1.0 chain will take more time. [Justin Drake] Q: Will it be possible with sharding to have shards with different rules and/or technology independent from the other shards/beacon chain, but still using the same base tech in terms of transacting and security? For example: private eth network run in a shard connected to main eth network from which it takes just security from validators. Private transaction with ZKsnarks shard(s). Encrypted data shards. Erc20 like coin launched on ETH 2.0, but with it's own rules and maybe own shards somehow controlled by the smart contract of that erc20. A: Every shard has the same data availability layer, and the option to use EVM2.0 as an execution engine. That's common base-layer infrastructure. At the application layer contracts can be powered by non-EVM2.0 execution engines (so-called alternative execution engines). There's also a huge L2 design around state channels, plasma, cross-shard communication, etc. So at the application layer I expect lots of non-homogeneity across shards, as well as a lots of homogeneity thanks to standardisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Today, running full nodes isn\u2019t that hard, but the resource requirements are slowly increasing. How much thinking is being devoted to the greater infrastructure requirements of Eth 2.0 and how they will impact node participation and decentralization? A: Ethereum 2.0 validation should be sustainable from a resource perspective: Bandwidth: fixed cost (thanks for fixes shard block sizes) Storage: if not fixed then sustainable (thanks to ideas such as storage maintenance fees). Note that storing shard blocks since genesis is not required. CPU, memory I/O: similar situation to Ethereum 1.0 (gas limit that can be voted up or down). [Justin Drake] Q: How ETH 2.0 differs from ETH, and why POS instead of POW. A: PoS enables goodies such as economic finality and sharding. It is also much cheaper (in terms of inflation cost for hodlers, as well as ecologically) than PoW. [Justin Drake] Part 2 Q: What do you feel is the biggest unsolved challenge left in Eth 2.0 research which must be addressed before Phase 1 or Phase 2 could be implemented in the future? A: I really honestly think that there are no unsolved research challenges at this point. It's mostly \"how do we make this thing more elegant and take up fewer lines of code and have fewer edge cases\" on the research side. [Vitalik] Better understanding the incentives and various actors that might arise in a stateless and highly abstracted execution model. There is really great work being led by both the EF eWASM team and the Consensys Quilt team to better understand the design space and active build prototypes to vet ideas. [Danny] Q: Previously, a release date of January 2020 for Phase 0 was informally articulated. Do you feel this date is realistic and achievable? A: Thanks for noting its informality. :) Launching early next year is my personal target, but there is a lot that needs to be done before then! We need: long-running test nets (however that is defined), formal verification of the deposit contract, and clients to be ready for prime time, but right now it looks like everything will come together in time. We also don't want to rush clients into developing buggy software just to be ready by an arbitrary date. If anything, I think BLS standardisation efforts are the most likely to slow us down. We (as a greater blockchain community) are trying very hard to have a standardised signature scheme for better interoperability between all the chains. There is a high degree of consensus on this already, but establishing a new standard is always a slow process. [Carl] The client teams are doing a great job and continuing to push the envelope. I expect exciting progress to be made in the coming months, but I also expect that the last mile might be long. Early 2020 is realistic and still the target. [Danny] Q: Are the researchers happy with the current state of the economics of Ethereum 2.0? A: I don't think it's productive for us to worry about the absolute numbers at this point; the network will launch, and either the rewards will prove sufficient or they won't. The other thing worth worrying about is centralization incentives, but that's difficult to work out \"in theory land\"; much of the result in practice has to do with how lazy people are. [Vitalik] Q: My biggest worry about ETH 2.0 is that it will kill composability. Won't most dapps end up trying to build on the same shard as say MakerDAO so they can use Dai? A: Composability between shards is definitely unchartered territory but there are reasons to be optimistic: The shards are designed for homogeneity (unlike, say, Polkadot or Cosmos) to facilitate cross-shard communication. There are design patterns which abstract away the boundaries between shards. For example, one could consider shards 0 and 1 as a combined data availability substrate for an execution engine which requires more bandwidth. These design patterns will be more easily exploitable in the context of programmable execution engines. The shards are designed to be friendly to \"fast optimistic finality\" thanks to shard attestations which are somewhat analogous to block confirmations in the context of Eth1. What this means that is, in practice, the shards may act as one logical blockchain thanks to quick probabilistic finality of individual shards. The UI layer is also an opportunity to abstract away the boundary between shards. [Justin] Q: When can we expect the Beacon Chain to be finalizing/checkpointing the Eth1.x chain? A: My best guess is early 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: Under the specs there is a \" block.eth1_data \" property; based on that I thought that somehow we were going to have an hybrid validation starting Jan 2020 (if all goes well) from both PoW and PoS. As stakers, what are we going to validate except the validators, staking rewards penalties if all the traffic will still be on eth 1.0 and we're not taking part? A: In order for Eth2 to finalise Eth1, 2 things are needed, Eth2 must vote on Eth1 (as is implemented as you point out) and Eth1 must change its fork rule to follow the finalised blocks on Eth1. The latter requirement requires an Eth1 hardfork. It is therefore easier to just have validator finalise the things you mention for now and later on add in Eth1 finalisation. Additionally, it is safer to launch without Eth1 finalisation in case of a Eth2 black-swan event in the early days. [Carl] Q: Rebuttals to the criticism that Eth 2.0 is extremely complex? A: It got considerably simpler over the last year. If you do a word count on the spec, it seems to be considerably smaller than the yellow paper at this point. There's a lot of things in eth2 that are much simpler than eth1. But there's definitely lingering complexity and I deeply care about minimizing it. [Vitalik] While the research path has been somewhat tortuous and hard to follow, the end product is arguably simple and clean. Expect more educational material highlighting the simplicity of the current design. Phase 0 is about 1024 lines of code to specify (assuming SHA256 and BLS12-381 as primitives). I expect phases 1 and 2 to be 1024 lines of code combined (assuming WASM as primitive). That's just the phase 0 consensus (deposit contract, beacon chain state transition function, and beacon chain fork choice rule). [Justin] Q: Why are there so many teams building eth2.0 clients? I understand the point of client diversity but don't you think 6 clients seem to be pushing it? Supporting so many clients would also divide the resources in terms of funding. Which clients do you see as the geth and parity of eth2.0? A: A few notes on client diversity: There's more than 6 clients being developed\u2014it's closer to 8. I expect consolidation\u2014a bunch of clients may not survive 2020. I expect specialisation\u2014one can focus on the browser (e.g. Lodestar), resource-constrained devices (e.g. Nimbus), the enterprise (e.g. Artemis), prototyping (e.g. Trinity), etc. A minimum of two production-ready clients are necessary for launch. I expect the first-mover advantage to be strong. All the above have, to an extent, historically happened on Eth1. [Carl] We definitely don't want a duopoly! For me personally, the ideal would be to have no single client exceed 1/3 of the network, so any software bug in any single client would not stop the network. Though having no single client exceed 1/2 is ok too and gets us most of the same benefit (if a major client has a bug, having no finality for a while while things are being figured out may even be an improvement...) I expect a power law distribution, and it's definitely likely that some of the clients will not survive to see significant usage on mainnet. [Vitalik] My guess on why so many clients showed up to do the hard work is that eth2.0 is both exciting as a purely technical challenge as well as a chance to make a mark on Ethereum and the crypto space in general. I'm pleased that there are so many great teams doing the hard work, but recently, I've been more focused on finding contributors to do value-add work outside of the core client implementation. Formal verification, academic analysis of protocols, testing, light clients, web3 interfaces and developer tooling, validator clients with great UX that plug into any underlying node, etc, etc. [Danny] Q: Are the Ethereum 2.0 clients eventually going to replace the 1.0 counterparts? For example, will Prism ever get merged to Geth? A: I expect the Eth1 clients to live a long and prosperous life :) On Prism: \"Likely not. Other than the language (Go), Prysm and Geth have very little in common.\" [Justin] Q: what happens when I stake 32 eth, and get slashed once? now that my stake is below 32 eth do i get kicked out of the validator set? A: Validators get kicked out when they get slashed. There is another ejection mechanism if your balance goes below 16 ETH from accumulating (non-slashing) penalties. [Justin] You also lose some amount of ETH. The minimum being set to 1 ETH currently. There is an additional penalty related to the number of other slashable offenses that have occurred in the recent time period. If more validators have been slashed recently, you lose more ETH. The maximum penalty occurs if ~1/3 of validators have been slashed recently, at which point you lose all ETH. This highlights the importance of having a discorrelated validator setup from other nodes and potentially having some fault tolerance setup with yourself before you sign things. [Danny] Q: What are the non-slashing offences? A: There are micro-penalties for not voting to finalise the same blocks as other validators and the inactivity penalty (for offline validators) for when the chain is not finalising for an extended period of time. [Carl] We have a bunch of micro-penalties for not optimally crafting attestations and penalties for being offline (search for get_attestation_deltasand get_crosslink_deltas here ). [Justin] Q: i hear a lot of hype around staking rewards, but what are the penalties for getting slashed? does the network have different punishments for different misbehavior (offline vs. double-signing)? is the \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\" still correct? A: I think you are conflating two thigs here, slashing and the inactivity leak. Inactivity leak If your validator node goes offline for 18 days, and the beacon chain is not finalizing, then your balance will be reduced by \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\". Slashing If a validator behaves provably maliciously, then they are slashed by having their balance reduced. Assuming client software is written well, this should be basically impossible to happen to you. Minimum penalty is 1 ETH, but it goes up linearly in the number of people slashed at the same time as you. See here for more [Carl] Important to note that if you are offline, but the chain is still finalizing you only stand to lose approximately the same as you would have gained. The quick reduction in balance over a ~2 week period only occurs when not finalizing. Another reason to have a discorrelated setup from the rest of the network! [Danny] Q:What is currently the most exciting new research development in Ethereum 2.0? A: The execution engine abstraction in phase 2 is quite exciting, taking account abstraction to the next level. It allows for the consensus part of execution to be an ultra thin layer of abstraction on top of data availability. Assuming WASM as a black box, it may be on the order of 256 lines of code to specify. There's an initial proposal from Vitalik here . The idea is that even the notion of a \"transaction\" is an application-layer detail which can be specified as WASM code. Compare this to Eth1 which \"enshrines\" an opinionated notion of replay protection (nonces), signatures (ECDSA), contracts, accounts (vs UTXOs), gas, storage, etc. [Justin] I'm lately most excited about this . The OVM work by Karl Floersch and co is along similar lines and also very interesting. [Vitalik] Q: Theres been some debate over the necessity of ASICs in Eth 2.0. I understand theres an effort to spread the cost out among various communities, but I think many people feel this might just end up being an expensive science project where the rewards dont justify the costs and if you itemised Eth 2.0, it seems like it might be the most expensive part. Are there alternatives besides relying on just Randao/Randao + ASICs (VDF)? What are the ELI5 upsides + downsides of the alternatives? I appreciate that the researchers are a tackling a difficult problem with randomness for a blockchain. A: It's important to stress that the VDF mechanism's safety is not critical to the safety of the Eth2 consensus; if the VDF scheme gets broken or someone makes an ASIC fast enough to predict all the outputs, all that happens is that the percentage of validators they need to corrupt a single committee drops by a few percentage points (think, from ~50% to ~33-40% plus a lot of computing power). I actually think the main value of the VDF is that it provides global trustable secure randomness to applications that need it. [Vitalik] +1 on consensus-layer security and/or performance gains, and value-add at the application-layer. The other \"promise\" of VDFs is that they are a new cryptographic building block with the rather unique notion of time. They can used for proofs of space, proofs of replication, proofs of history, anti-frontrunning, expiring zk-proofs, and hopefully further applications which are hard to predict today. [Justin] Q: I'd like to know more about the data availability layer of Ethereum 2.0 - particularly the economic costs of long-term data storage. Part of my political platform includes integrating blockchain technology with government operations. For example, I'd like to see all of America's public records stored on a public, open source, sufficiently decentralized blockchain. Would it make sense to build something like this on top of Ethereum 2.0? Why or why not? A: Realistically you would want an incentivized data storage platform like Swarm, with hashes of the documents stored on the ethereum blockchain. But I'd recommend thinking harder and trying to figure out how to answer the deeper question \"how could we use blockchains as a tool to minimize opportunities for misbehavior in government?\" Places to start I can think of include: Things like https://opencerts.io/ for all government-issued records Using https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413/ to do online votes, starting in low-security contexts (I think petitions would be a good place to start and underexplored) An internal-use stablecoin where only government agencies can hold balances but transactions are visible to and auditable by the public Some kind of zero-knowledge privacy-preserving sales tax collection thing Blockchain-based solutions for esoteric government things like spectrum auctions Get your country (I'm speaking generically to all readers here :D) to make an Estonian-style E-ID system that lets people make digital signatures that can be verified by anyone publicly. This is not technically a blockchain application, but it would be a tool useful in many blockchain applications [Vitalik] Q: I recall /u/bobthesponge once saying that almost his entire Net worth is in Ether (even his salary from the EF). Are there any other researchers on the research team that are as convinced of Ethereum's future, besides Vitalik and Justin of course? No need to call someone out. Just percentages, ie. \"Over 50% of the research team is heavily (over 30% of net worth) invested in Ether financially\", would be sufficient. A: Somewhat ingrained in our culture, the research team doesn't talk much about net worths. Having said that, the research team has a lot of fresh blood (e.g. Dankrad, Proto, Carl) which I don't expect to be crazy invested in ETH.[Justin] I am not an eth whale, but I get paid in eth and have high exposure. [Danny] The aforementioned Carl here, let's put it this way: financially, emotionally, and intellectually, I am heavily exposed to ETH. [Carl] Q: How many Eth2.0 client teams have to have a finished client for the Beacon chain to go live? A: I asked the same question a few days ago. At this moment, it is still an open question and will likely be until much loser to the time. Obviously having more clients is better, but that should be played off against the launch date. I am currently torn between 2 and 3. (Having 2 would be great because otherwise there is a client guaranteed to have a majority of the validator-base.) At the end of the day, it will come down to who is ready and when. [Carl] Two at minimum, ideally three. [Justin] Q: I understand that about 10 million eth is expected to provide good enough security for the network. In a hypothetical scenario, what happens in the situation where a large organization manage to secure more than 50% of the total eth staked and use it to maliciously attack the network? As i understand, the side with less total eth staked will be slashed, so won't this malicious actor be able to effectively kill the network? A: If a large actor were to aquire a large enough stake to take over the network they would need to buy 2/3 of the total staking supply which would drive the price up, so it's not a cheap attack in the first place. Secondly, you are not slashed if you vote for a minority chain, only if you behave provably maliciously in the eyes of 2/3 of the validators. One of the beautiful things about PoS is that these attacks can be handled with grace. We, as a community, can go in and hard-fork out the malicious actors so they have no more voting power. The malicious actors just burnt a lot of money to temporally halt a network. In PoW, by contrast, if someone buys ASICS with 51% hash power, there is no way to remove them from the system. [Carl] Q:Do the client teams feel their implementations will be sufficiently robust enough, stable enough, and easy enough to use that normal nerds (like myself) can safely run their node software, stake 32 ETH on it, and not be slashed or lose ETH due to client bugs? My biggest concern is losing ETH while being a well intentioned actor. I've ran Geth, Parity, Trinity, and EthereumJ (Harmony) nodes for multiple years now and those clients have been around a lot longer than any of the ETH 2.0 clients have, but they still have issues, still have bugs, still sometimes crash. A: I hope so! One key component in the incentive design is that penalties (for going offline and for being slashed) are only high if many other validators go offline at the same time. So any bug that doesn't hit every node at the same time should only cost you a minimal amount. [Vitalik] Q:suppose ethereum reaches 1 mllion tps, ledger size will grow 1 terabyte everyday, any solution to this? what is your projections in terms of ledger size growh and what is your solution to this A: The sharded eth2.0 is expected to handle ~10MB/s of data availability. This is data that is come to consensus upon in shard chains and guaranteed to be available in at least the ~2 week time frame. This is not necessarily state size. The current approach to state and state execution is to take a \"state-less\" approach in which blocks must contain the merkle witnesses of the relevant state to perform the tx executions. This is reduces the amount of state any consensus node must store, but does bring up other issues about state size, who stores it, how users get it, etc. In fact, the entirety of state execution is being abstracted away such that we can experiment with multiple schemes to deal with this problem (state rent, users/dapps storing their own data, etc). Much of the state rent research that @ledgerwatch has driven in the past year or so will likely come into play. [Danny] Q: Lets assume you are a guy with very little cryptotech-knowledge, but you do have 32 ETHER. Question #1: Would staking be made easy-to-do, so \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? Question #2: Does staking pose any risks of losing ETH by accident? Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network (eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise) A: Would staking be made easy-to-do, s\u00e5 \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? I expect a cottage industry will be setup around accessibility. Infrastructure to be built includes staking pools (centralised\u2014think Coinbase\u2014as well as decentralised one) as well as plug-and-play \"validator in a box\" solutions. Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network That's definitely the goal. eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise Penalties should be marginal for validator nodes that go offline for short periods of time every once in a while. [Justin] Q: What is the current thinking around the Eth1 Eth2 migration plan? A: The current approach is to fold eth1 into eth2 as an execution environment. In practice, this will mean that we would need to have a hard fork on the eth1 side to rebalance some gas costs (opcodes that read storage or read accounts would see their gas costs increased to 2000-10000), and after that at some point there will be a \"flag block height\" from which the eth1 state root will be moved into the eth2 system (or possibly some one-time processing will be run on the eth1 state to make some optimizations, eg. replacing the patricia hex trie with a binary tree) and after that eth1 will be part of eth2, with applications being able to run as before. I do think the likely gas cost increase of storage/account reading opcodes (basically the same opcodes whose gas costs were already increased in Tangerine Whistle; those costs will need to go up at least another order of magnitude) is something that contract devs should be aware and plan for. The reason that change will be necessary is that those opcodes greatly increase the size of a Merkle proof needed to statelessly verify a block, so currently Merkle proofs for a worst-case block are 100 MB; with those gas repricings plus trie optimization plus charging per byte of any contract being read, we could get it down to acceptable levels. [Vitalik] Q: Regarding Proof-of-Stake and wealth distribution (and issuance reduction), by the looks of it the majority of ETH will be held by the minority of entities, does that cause any concern since a single entity can run multiple validator nodes (and earn more rewards)? It's a question from inequality perspective not security; if ETH were to take a significant role in the global economy, wouldn't this widen the gap between rich and poor by orders of magnitude (MUCH worse than the current economic system)? Basically, economic inequality on steroids. A: I definitely think income inequality issues from crypto are an issue! It's a big part of why I am not a single-cryptocurrency maximalist. But I still think that PoW is not better than PoS from an inequality point of view, because although PoW does distribute coins into \"fresh hands\", you need so much capital to become a PoW miner that PoW itself is a big rich-get-richer mechanic in practice. [Vitalik] Q: I know its still early but are there some rough estimates of when we might see Spec freezes for Phase 1 and 2? A: Phase 2 is a bit too far out to say, but my hope for phase 1 is Q3/4 of this year. [Carl] That said, the current minimal execution design with EEs for phase 2 (once better researched and prototyped) is a super simple addition on top of phase 1 [Danny] Q: Please ELI5 (\"explain like I'm five\") why the need for a second chain instead keeping on evolving the first one? A: Building Eth2 on Eth1 would be a bad design decision for a few reasons: We would be constrained by the Eth1 gas limit, which would severely affect performance (e.g. 1024 shards and 32 ETH to validate would not be possible). We would be mixing the consensus and application layers. This means the consensus layer is subject to the application-layer DoS vectors (e.g. high gas prices). It would also mean \"enshrining\" application-layer contracts, which is far from ideal from a governance standpoint which should be as neutral as possible with regards to deployed contracts (i.e. The DAO interventions should be the exception, not the norm). We would be constrained by the EVM, which is notoriously hard to safely program complex contracts in. Eth1 does not have support for BLS12-381. We would be subject to the Eth1 block time Poisson distribution (as opposed to the regular\u2014and shorter\u2014slots durations in Eth2). The list goes on :) [Justin] Q: I am considering to stake during phase 0, but i am a bit concerned about the inactivity leak. I want to know how to stop/pause being a validator if I change my mind? I am asking this as there may be certain situations in which I think I will be offline for a while, and I do not want my balance to slowly leak out due to that. A: You will only suffer large penalties if you are offline at the same time that 1/3 of other validators are offline. Otherwise the penalties for being offline will be tiny, to the point where you will be net-profitable (not including computer costs etc) as long as you are online more than ~50-67% of the time. The incentives are deliberately designed to be forgiving to avoid discouraging amateur setups to promote decentralization. [Vitalik] The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Q: 1024 shards, 131,000+ validator slots... what happens if there aren't enough validator slots filled by the time sharding goes live? A: With 1024 shards, and 128 validators in a committee, a minimum of 131,072 validators are needed to crosslink every shard every slot. If there are fewer validators than this, then shards are skipped to ensure the 128/committee validator number. [Carl] The system can naturally handle as low as ~64 validators. In this case, security is obviously insanely degraded, but the protocol can technically move forward. [Danny] Technically the system can \"move forward\" with one validator :D But yes, below the 131,072 validator (4.1M ETH) level the properties of the system progressively degrade as the number of validators goes lower and lower. [Vitalik] Q: if i understand finalization correctly, the more validators you have the longer it takes to finalize. how is eth2 addressing this issue without pounding the network with tons of messages being sent between all the validators? A: Correct. I wrote an article about this fundamental tradeoff here: https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735 We managed to get a couple orders of magnitude more favorable tradeoff curve than other projects through BLS signature aggregation, which reduces the marginal cost of a signature to 1 bit of data and 1 ECADD (~0.001 traditional signature verifications) of computation. [Vitalik] In Eth2, more validators should not lead to (significantly) longer finalization times. By making use of BLS signature aggregation and by grouping the validators into committees, we're able to support hundreds of thousands (and hopefully into the millions) of validators. [Carl] Q: Has the EF given any thought to maybe issuing \"official\" NFTs (i.e. collectibles) to initial stakers upon the launch of Beacon Chain as an \"extra incentive\"? What's your opinion on this? I'd say this would be the remit of the community, not the EF. Note that the Eth2 designers avoided giving early validators a special reward (e.g. giving the first 16,384 validators a 1 ETH bounty) to avoid distorting the economic experiment. We want to learn whether or not the basic incentivises are sufficient to incentivise participation. [Justin] I actually like the idea of an NFT. The deposit contract is readable in such a way that proofs can be made to a separate contract to generate NFTs. Been talking to Austin Griffith about this. He/burner-wallet might take the charge. I don't think an NFT would hinder our ability to understand the pure incentivizes here. It's at best a trophy and of little economic value imo. [Danny] Q: How is the work on evaluating the feasibility of producing dedicated VDF hardware coming along? A: At this point there's reasonably high confidence that VDFs (including building hardware) are viable. A few updates: A team of 3 ex-Intel people (Simon, Sean, Kelly from Supranational) is dedicated to the hardware aspects. The Rivest timelock challenge (open for 20 years, designed to last 35 years) was cracked in a few months using an FPGA (see here, and here). There's also code on Github. Work by Erdinc Ozturk has improved the state-of-the-art circuit depth for the modular exponentiation in VDFs. The ePrint paper was submitted a few days ago and should be published soon. A prominent complexity theorist (Ryan Williams from MIT) is working on circuit depth lower bounds for modular multiplication. Significant progress was made by Ligero on the RSA ceremony. We are planning for a ceremony with unprecedented scale (1024 participants) in 2020. New research papers keep flowing in\u2014see http://vdfresearch.org The $100K FPGA competition is starting in a few weeks. We have relevant corporate sponsors for the FPGA and ASIC competitions. In addition to the Ethereum Foundation and Protocol Labs (i.e. Filecoin), a new blockchain project (to be announced with the FPGA competition) is helping with funding. $900K was raised in the latest round of funding. [Justin] Q: Is there a chance for obligatory anonymity of future validator withdrawals? Force every withdrawal to go to a shielded pool - like zcash does with mining rewards. I fear without the obligatory anonymity here just using a mixer/etc is going to be treated as extremely suspicious - forcing stakers would add plausible deniability. A: I definitely support moving toward more and more privacy being a default over time! I'd say validator deposits are more important to mix than withdrawals, as that way it becomes harder to locate the nodes of specific validators which seems like it would increase security and censorship resistance. [Vitalik] Q: What are the main incentives to run a beacon node for validators if they can just connect to high-up time beacon nodes?If there are beacon node providers with high up-time - how is this going to be decentralized? A: There is an anti-centralisation incentive mechanism baked in. Basically, validators get punished for going offline the more other validators are offline at the same time. So \"uncorrelated downtime\" should be optimised in addition to \"high uptime\". [Justin] Q: If, as a validator, I know that I'm going to be offline for a period of time, is is possible to 'pause' validating without suffering an inactivity leak? A: The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Clarification: there's a minimum ~1 day period before you can withdraw after you exit. It's safe to be offline during that time, but it does prevent you from re-entering. If we want to, in some future version we could add a \"re-enter\" feature that allows immediate re-depositing without waiting to withdraw first.... there's no theoretical reason why such a thing would not be possible. [Vitalik] Q: Do we have clarity yet on whether currently locked-down smart contracts (eg metronomes 4 contracts by Jeff garzik) will continue to work seamless in ETH2.0 or whether these contracts will be deprecated with all ETH in them lost? And how can storage costs be added to locked-down contracts in ETH 1.x ? In other words can we all assume immutable contracts on ETH1.0 will continue to work forever (provided enough people want them to)? Thx A: The current plan is that eth1 will be folded into eth2 as an execution environment via the stateless client approach, in which case, yes, contracts will keep working as expected. [Vitalik] Q: According to this paper, it may be possible for Quantum Computers to hijack and re-sign transactions DURING BLOCKTIME by (as early as) 2027. In other words, ownership of ANY wallet that has not upgraded to a quantum secure signature scheme BEFORE THEN can no longer be trusted AT ALL (even WITHOUT previous outgoing transactions). SO THE QUESTION IS THIS: Is anyone who fails to manually upgrade their wallets before a deadline (in order to become quantum secure) guaranteed to lose their funds after the advent of Quantum Computers? For example, if someone stores a PAPER WALLET for let's say 20 years, are they going to lose their funds by that time? Can QCs just monitor the entire blockchain and automatically attempt to hijack any transaction with insecure signature scheme during one blocktime, even if the sender has no previous outgoing transactions? A: Even if a quantum computer gets announced as immediately usable tomorrow, it is possible to do an emergency procedure to secure the funds of everyone who has not yet publicly released their public key or a signature (ie. every standard account holder that has not signed a transaction). You do this by doing a soft fork to disallow standard transactions, and replace them with a special transaction type that uses a STARK to prove that you own the private key k such that the given address A equals to hash(G * k)[12:] , and then moves the funds over into a new address type that uses a quantum-secure signature scheme, eg. Winternitz signatures. If we get more warning, then we can get people to update to Winternitz on an orderly schedule. TLDR: we're fine. [Vitalik] Q: how do/will the performance bottlenecks compare between 1.x and 2.0 A: 2.0 removes the disk I/O bottleneck for consensus participants by heavily leaning towards stateless clients. Finality greatly mitigates the sync latency bottleneck, and the requirement for consensus participants to store historical blocks. [Justin] I'd also add that I expect light clients to be massively more viable in eth2 than in eth1. About the same order of magnitude load as a bitcoin light client to stay synced (as opposed to eth1, where light clients are not light enough in practice to run on phones...) [Vitalik] Q: As an ETH miner, my main concern is how to prep for ETH 2.0. Any wiki, tips, or advice on how to proceed contributing (and profiting) for Ethereum? A: Eth2 has no mining. You may be able to put those GPUs to good use at the application layer with protocols like Golem, or maybe protocols that incentivise GPU-accelerated SNARK proofs. [Justin] Q: Approximately when is ETH issuance supposed to drop dramatically? (I believe the figure I've come accross is 10x reduction in issuance, is this correct also?) A: When the PoW chain starts piggybacking on the PoS chain for security (this could happen during phase 1 or phase 2), it becomes safe to lower the PoW chain reward by maybe ~4x. Further reductions would happen when the PoW chain stops entirely. [Vitalik] Q: During Phase 0, will ETH 2.0 be transferrable between wallets? 2.0 to 2.0? If so, are there concerns exchanges will list ETH 2.0? A: Transfers will probably only go live in Phase 1 at which point exchanges will list ETH2.0. Having exchanges to so will help maintain price-parity between ETH and ETH2.0. [Carl] Q: if block reward is X eth, and it is enough to secure the block, why do we pay X+gas to miners? Will this change? A: In Eth2 the economic security is not a direct function of the block rewards. Instead, it is a function of the total amount at stake. Will this change? Eth2 should have a partial fee burning mechanism (see EIP1559). [Justin] Q: As ETH 2.0 currently stands what are the odds of a uni-directional vs bi-directional 1.x to 2.0 bridge? A: The uni-directional Eth1 - Eth2 bridge comes with the beacon chain. I'd say it's likely there will be a bi-directional bridge eventually (though unlikely to happen in 2020). Even better than a bi-directional bridge (based on light clients, which comes with non-negligible latency) is native integration of Eth1 into Eth2 (see here). [Justin] Q: Will the issuance rate be enough to incentivize validators given the competition from say DeFi products and will it be changed in the future if needed? A: Compound rates for ETH are ~0.02% AFAIK, so very easy to compete with. The \"do you take 3% interest staking or 6% lending DAI on Compound\" framing is highly misleading, because that 6% is on USD, which is very different to having 3% on ETH. But over time I do expect interest rates on ETH to slide up as more forms of staking become available (eg. channels, Plasma, Truebit, other security deposit games...). [Vitalik] Q: What are the research team's thoughts / plans on if there is extreme price differences between ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0? I would think arbitrage would solve the issue but haven't thought too deeply on the subject myself. In paticular, if ETH 1.0 coins are worth significantly more causing people to not want to redeem their ETH 2.0 coins because they will instantly take a price hit versus just selling. A: I'm not too worried: Transfers and exchanges can be used to redeploy \"cheap\" Eth2 coins for validation. Large holders (e.g. the EF) can be arbitragers. The greater the price delta, the greater the incentive to deliver a two-way bridge ASAP. [Justin] Q: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? If no, is there any other mechanism to prevent adversaries that can corrupt a shard quickly from applying an invalid state transition? A: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yep! If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Looks like ~10x data (though very low computation, and we expect data to be cheaper than computation). But with techniques like https://ethresear.ch/t/layer-2-state-schemes/5691, even that could potentially be unnecessary. [Vitalik] Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yes. are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Now that execution engines are application layer, the answer is technically 0 :) For execution engines that use large Merkle trees (e.g. Eth1) the rough estimate at one point was 8x. I'm personally excited for execution engines that do Merkle path \"witness compression\" using SNARKs (proof creation accelerated by GPUs, FPGAs, or even ASICs). [Justin] Q: What is the current design to move Ether tokens on eth1 to eth2? A: That depends on what you mean by \"Ether tokens\". Validators can send a deposit of 32 ETH to the deposit contract which is then transferred to the beacon chain where they can begin validation. For people who wish to transfer their ETH from Eth1- 2, that is not something that has been decided upon yet, but there will (probably) exist a dedicated bridge for this purpose (otherwise they can go through the deposit contract). It is still too early to know about ERC20/721 tokens. If Eth2 has an Eth1 execution engine, then it could be pretty painless, but even if not, an ERC20 token could just be transferred by copying over its state root. [Carl] Q: Sorry in advance if my questions are dumb but I didn't follow closely Ethereum 2.0 for couple months. Is there an approximative release date? Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? A: Is there an approximative release date? January 3, 2020 at the earliest for phase 0. I'd say Q1 2020 is likely. Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? 32 ETH. Rewards depend on the total number of validators, individual validator performance, and the gas markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the typical validator has an annual return around 10%. What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? I'm proud to have been able to make a contribution in a beautiful piece of infrastructure I believe will radically change the world in a positive way :) Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? No. [Justin] Q: When sharding is released, will there just suddenly be 1024 shards in existence, or will there be a small but growing number of shards as usage goes up? Starting with such a high number will leave a lot of unused space/capacity A: All 1024 shards will be launched at once. Growing the number of shards is (probably) unneeded complexity. Shards with lots of unused capacity will have lower gas prices attracting more users. Q: How can the average person help with eth2.0? Donations? Documentation? Are there any organized efforts underway? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: After the scaling issues are solved will this be an economical platform to host backend logic on? How will this compare to running your own server or going through a cloud hosting company in terms of cost and ease of use for light or heavy workloads? Personally, my highest anticipated use case is hosting multiplayer matchmaking and signaling, though I haven\u2019t built such a system yet out of concern for difficulty and cost. A: It's unlikely that Eth2 on its will be used as a backend for heavy workloads, the data throughput is likely just too high. That said, it works really well as a dispute resolution layer so a centralised service can run the backend optimistically and if someone disagrees with the execution, they can contest and have it resolved on Eth2. For lighter use-cases it probably can, but this is more in the context of a dapp. [Carl] Q: I was under the assumption that ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain, no need to swap coins or anything but will this transition from ETH1 to ETH2 cause a fork in the community similar to ETC Ethereum classic and ETH chain? Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? A: ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Eth2 is such a big upgrade over Eth1 that it is easier to implement as an entirely new chain than to upgrade. See Justin's ELI5 here for more . Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? The large majority of it, yes. Rewards are also issued on the Eth2 chain so that increases the supply there too. Ultimately, the expectation is that all Eth1 ETH will be transferred to Eth2. Q: Do you think its worth laying 6 month/1 year/2 year 'ground rules' for Eth 2.0 chain assuming something unexpectedly goes wrong? A: My concern with doing something like this is its inflexibility. It is basically impossible to cover all the possible cases and even if we could, I'd argue that such an approach is too inflexible to handle the intricacies of exactly how something has failed. Handling it on a case-by-case basis seems like a better solution to me. [Carl] Q: Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? For example like proposed with Casper, every 100th block will be validated by PoS. A: The integration between Eth1 and Eth2 is a roadmap orthogonal to phases 1, 2, 3 of Eth2. Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? My best guess is this will happen in 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: What happens if you send more ETH to the deposit contract? Like 32.1 or 40? A: Nothing is stopping you from sending 32 Eth to the deposit contract, but you'll only receive rewards on the first 32 Eth, so it's not something I'd really recommend. [Carl] That's fine. Your balance will reflect the deposit, and the balance in excess of 32 ETH can be transferred to another validator (phase 1) or to a shard (phase 2). [Justin] Q: What's the easiest set up to stake let's say 320 ETH? A: A laptop should be capable of handling around 10 validators so you should be able to send 10*32 Eth to the deposit contract and start validating on your 1 machine. [Carl] A laptop should be sufficient. We'll know more in a few months when the numbers for block sizes and gas limits of shard blocks get finalized. [Vitalik] Q: What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I read you're involved in discussions with them, have you helped each other in developing code? A: I read you're involved in discussions with them I've had brief VDF discussions with Harmony. have you helped each other in developing code? Don't think so, at least not yet. What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I had a brief look at their whitepaper which seems to be inspired by Ethereum. So I guess my opinion is that their approach to scalability is great :) [Justin] Q: If Eth 2.0 introduces PoS, are there legal hurdles to be clarified upon? Could the token be considered a security token? A: I'm not aware of any jurisdiction that considers ETH on Eth1 a security, and since ETH on Eth2 is basically the same as ETH on Eth1 (other than the temporary technicality of two separate tokens) then ETH on Eth2 should not be a security. [Justin] Q: I'm planning to run a beacon node + N validators. Do you think this will will be able to be managed by a Raspberry Pi 4? I'm aware that it is being worked out to have ARM64 binaries ready soon, the question is if it seems realistic not to have a computer running at home and instead running something smaller and cleaner environmentally speaking like a Pi4. A: That depends on \"N\". I (personally) fully expect a RPi3 to be able to run at least one validator node, but we'll only know this when clients are closer to delivery. [Carl] Q: What are some smaller things that you guys would like an average r/ethtrader community member could help with? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: Is there any clarity on the transition process regarding basic aspects like whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example, and whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? Better asked, how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? A: whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example Beacon eth will be sellable on exchanges when transfers are enabled in phase 1. whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? That will come later, see here . how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? The long term plan is to natively integrate Eth1 into Eth2. See here . [Justin] Q: Can you explain somewhat precisely how cross sharding communication would work. As in how does shard node A talk to shard node B without going through some sort of intermediary? If they can do this talking, why can't it be used for eth to talk to say bitcoin. A: The intermediary is the beacon chain, or infrastructure optimistically predicting what will eventually get finalised in the beacon chain. [Justin] Q: How would you objectively judge the level of technological advancement of current eth and current bitcoin as far as the very limited function of sending coins from A to B is concerned? A: Eth1 and Bitcoin are comparable for on-chain payments. [Justin] Q: Presuming you agree price drives security, and presuming you agree all cryptos reside in a very competitive environment, are there any plans to address the increased issuance that the Beacon chain would bring? In addition, are there any plans to meet or maybe even surpass bitcoin's coded reduction of new supply to 2% next year. And related, what would you say to the criticisms that have already been expressed whereby if you can reduce issuance by say 10x, you can increase it too. Or asked in a more open question manner, what do you think of this process through which increases or decreases of issuance are made? A: It's possible Eth2 will cause net-negative issuance. The reason is that ETH gets burned via transaction fees. Pushing code to the beacon chain will also burn ETH. Finality, the penalties also burns ETH. [Justin] Q: Will phase 0 contain any scalability improvements? How many transactions per second will Ethereum be able to handle with Sharding? A: Phase 0 will allow for a light client that can give you hashes of the eth1 chain in a fairly lightweight way (but not too lightweight, you'll need ~200kb per 6 minutes to keep up with the committees, this will go down to 200kb per a few days with phase 1). This could be used to allow eg. light clients inside of browsers to work efficiently. That's a kind of scalability improvement, and an underdiscussed one imo. [Vitalik] Phase 0's purpose is tracking validators' states and producing randomness, asking about its scalability is not really meaningful. Regarding Tx/s, the answer is not really known. As a basic calculation, if each shard has the same throughput as Eth1.x, then we'll have 16 * 1024 = 16,384 Tx/s (assuming no inter-shard Txs). That said, the above numbers are kinda meaningless as Eth2 is designed to be used along with L2 scaling solutions like Rollups and OVM which could yield insanely high throughputs. [Carl] Q: Can you address points 2 - 4 in this tweet ? A: The default idea for clocks in eth2 is https://ethresear.ch/t/network-adjusted-timestamps/4187. There has not been that much work done on writing \"policeman\" software that would detect slashable violations by validators and penalize them, but I am not worried about this. Reasons: Even if no one writes the code, that just means the security model degrades to honest majority, which is not the worst One client implementing the code correctly is sufficient If a client implements the code badly, there's no consensus risk, they could just ship with badly written code that only works half the time and it would catch half the slashable violations. I'll defer to Danny on wire protocol stuff. [Vitalik] Point 2: \"Wire protocol\" = This is an implementation detail that I'm sure the implementers will agree upon soon enough :) The high-level recommendation from the research team is to use libp2p as the networking stack (dicv5 for discovery) and SSZ for serialisation. But this cannot enforced at the consensus layer, and we've already seen alternatives (e.g. clients using Whiteblock for networking, and Prysm is using protobufs in some places). Point 3: \"Clients to slash surround votes\" = Not sure what this means. The spec clearly defines the slashing mechanism for surround votes. See is_slashable_attestation_data. Point 4: \"Decentralized network time protocol\" = Just like Eth1, clocking is an implementation detail. It is to an extent decentralised (e.g. there are alternatives to NTP such as GPS, one can choose his/her NTP servers, one can use local clocks, etc.). It would be nice to have something even more robust but this is research territory\u2014not required for launch of Eth2. [Justin] Q: Why aren't Beacon nodes rewarded? Wouldn't this allow the network to be more decentralized? A: Validators are rewarded. Beacon nodes that are not validators are not rewarded in protocol because the protocol can't tell who's a beacon node vs just pretending to be one (eg. via 100 fake nodes pointing to the same real node). Though non-validator nodes may be able to earn money in eth2 through incentivized light client protocols. Q: In regards to the recent proposal of vitalik to use the bcash chain as a short-term scaling solution until eth 2.0 launches: is eth 2.0 still on track? is there a concrete demand for an interim solution? A: The main motivation for proposing an interim solution (if you don't like bitcoin cash for political reasons, I also recommended ethereum classic, I think it's also a good choice) is to make it easier for the work on building these layer 2s to be able to get off the ground in parallel with finalizing the work on the eth2 layer 1 itself. In general, the ethereum community is large, so doing things in parallel is its advantage. [Vitalik] Q: You do not plan to work on the creation of parachain (eth 2.0.) On Polkadot? I don't think EF will have to drive this. Web3/Parity are on it and I believe consider it to be a top priority. The Shasper (Parity) client is written in substrate to help facilitate this happening. [Danny] Q: Pretty basic but what's a realistic estimate of throughput after every is put together? A: Somewhere between 5000 and 500000 TPS depending on what execution environment and transaction type you're using. [Vitalik] Q: Could you say anything about the adoption of Ethereum Blockchain? Are there plans to create something like a B2B team actively approaching \"qualified\" companys? A: I'd say the Ethereum Foundation's primary focus is the consensus layer (research, development, education, maintenance, etc.), more so than the application layer. [Justin] Data Questions with Justin Drake Q: How much data will there be in Eth2? JD: As the spec currently stands, on average 2.8MB/s across all shards with a \"burst mode\" which is 4x that (i.e. 11.3MB/s). Q: What does this translate into for state size? JD: At the consensus layer block size and state size are basically orthogonal considerations. Consensus-layer state size will always remain very small since we lean heavily on stateless clients. In theory application-layer state (\"L2 state\") can grow up to 2.8MB/s. For execution engines without state rent, you can expect state to grow roughly as fast as Eth1 state grows today. Multiply that by 1024 shards and the situation is possibly not long-term sustainable. This is a significant reason why I personally believe we should progressively launch execution engines (as opposed to allowing anyone to deploy EEs at launch), starting with an EE that has state rent. Q: What role do nodes play (versus validators)? JD: At the consensus layer non-validator nodes don't play any role. At the networking layer they can act as lubricants to relay message. They may also help create blocks for block proposers, i.e. be \"relayers\". Q: Who will run these nodes? JD: Nodes can be run by anyone who wants \"direct\" access to Eth2 (e.g. service providers such as exchanges, etherscan, power users). Relayer nodes may be run by specialised businesses. Q:For someone that needs to run a node (EtherScan), what will the resourcing look like? JD: They will get their data by being nodes and listening on the gossip networks. The bad news is that bandwidth should grow by roughly 1024x to keep track of all shards. But then again, that's not terrible news because a good internet connection (especially server-class) can handle 4 11.2MB/s (the 4 is, say, the gossiping overhead). The good news is that consensus state is minimal (again, stateless clients), which means zero consensus-layer I/O which is currently an Eth1 bottleneck. They can then choose withever EEs and/or dApps it wants to support, i.e. it's opt-in. Q:How do we assume all data is stored and available? JD: For recent blocks we have quite sophisticated infrastructure, including proofs of custody in phase 1 and data availability proofs (possibly phase 2). For historical blocks we rely on the ecosystem to keep them around. Q:What will \"historical blocks\" be needed for. As in, if they were lost forever, what would be messed up? JD: Historical blocks are required to recompute application-layer state, and may also contain application-layer receipts. If they were lost forever (which I don't expect would ever happen) then applications without at least one synced full node may lose user state. Q:Will people congregate on a few shards? JD: Hard to tell. Naive dApp design would suggest that dApps would aggregate into clusters within shard boundaries. We are exploring dApp designs that are somewhat shard-agnostic, i.e. consume data availability from shards as a fungible resource. Q:Quick explanation of cross shard communication and where research is? JD: Cross shard communication is a huge design space, just like \"plasma\" or \"state channels\". At the consensus layer we don't provide much infrastructure beyond crosslinks. I'm expecting significant experimentation in the early days followed by standardisation, somewhat similar to the token transfer design space and the ERC20 standard. One big idea is the concept of \"optimistic crosslink\" which are shared between shards in advance of the real crosslinks, and which with high probability will match the actual crosslinks that get finalised. dApps can use optimistic crosslinks to get super-low cross-shard latency. Q:Why 1024 shards? JD: Because 2048 shards would be stressing the beacon chain and 512 shards would be under-utilising the beacon chain. Resources: Part 1 Part 2","title":"Ethereum 2.0 AMA"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#ethereum-20-reddit-ama","text":"","title":"Ethereum 2.0 Reddit AMA"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#part-1","text":"Q: When, as in period of time, do you think Ethereum will be able to solve scalability issues? A: In phase 1 (about 2020 by my estimate) we will have shard data. Those shards, even without an EVM, can be used as the data availability layer for TrueBit (and other alternative execution engines). Phase 2 (about 2021) is when we will have scalable L1 execution. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: ELI5 execution engines Follow up A: An execution engine is a way to compute state assuming consensus on data. The execution engine for the EVM is \"naive re-execution\". There are more fancy execution engines such as TrueBit and SNARK/STARK-based validity proofs. [Justin Drake] Q: Are economists being consulted to help decide the issuance rate of a full POS system? Stated more broadly, who is helping/advising the ETH 2.0 team on the effects certain issuance decisions will have on the network and community (both in the short and long term)? A: Personally at this point the feedback I'm most interested in is actually feedback from potential stakers. The main question basically being, are there any other tweaks we can make to the economics that, given a fixed level of reward, will (i) encourage more people to validate, and (ii) encourage many small solo validators or smaller pools, as opposed to a few large pools. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Considering that Yoichi is not working anymore in the Foundation, what are your plans on formal verification of ETH 2.0 specs? A: I'd say that formal verification of the spec will make sense when the spec is more mature and stable, maybe mid 2019. Anyone interested in doing formal verification of the ETH 2.0 specs in a few months, please send a grant proposal. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the best response to a developer who is hesitant about building on ethereum today, given that it will be \"replaced\" by ETH 2.0 over the next few years? A: I expect that once the state and execution model for Serenity solidifies (see https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 for one minimal proposal) we'll start working with the developer community on modifications to high-level languages (Solidity, Vyper, etc) and best practices. Hopefully at that point it will become clearer how to build applications in such a way that they could be redeployed as-is on the 2.0 chain. At least that's my hope. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Building on Ethereum 1.0 today is great for learning and prototyping. It's also great for assembling a culturally-aligned team consistent with the philosophy of the Ethereum community (which may be different than the philosophy of the Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Tether, etc. communities). [Justin Drake] Q: Can we run multiple validator clients on a single machine assuming we've got multiple 32 Eth deposits? A: Yep! There's nothing preventing you from using one machine to run multiple validators. The only hard limit you'll face is that the number of shards you are assigned to validate increases linearly with the number of validator slots you have, so if you have thousands of ETH a laptop will not suffice and you'll need something more powerful. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Short answer: Yes. Long answer: You will need to register a validator for every 32 ETH. In phase 0 (just the beacon chain, no shards) you can likely handle thousands of validators on a single machine. After phase 1 the number of validators that can be operated on a single machine depends on how resourceful your machine is. A mainstream laptop should comfortably handle one validator, and likely handle 2-10 validators at max capacity. The computational resources scales linearly with the number of validators until you reach ~1,000 validators. At that point there are scalability advantages in being a super-node, i.e. a full node for every shard. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: How much importance are the devs placing on being able to run setups at home wrt keeping Ethereum decentralised and being able to move ETH in and out of staking pools? Follow up A: It's definitely a goal I care about. The alternative to staking at home is staking on AWS or staking through a pool, and both are risks for decentralization. Concrete ways we try to be friendly to staking at home: Relatively forgiving penalties for being offline, so you earn a net profit as long as you're online more than ~50-67% of the time Keeping the cost of validating the beacon chain low The anti-correlation penalty scheme, which more heavily penalizes validators that misbehave at the same time as many other validators (which is more likely if you're on the same pool or VPS or whatever). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: How can I help / get involved? I fell in love with Ethereum not too long ago. I\u2019ve been reading Zcash\u2019s BLS12-381 Elliptic Curves and for the past few days these are all thats been on my mind. I love this project now and just found ethresear.ch. I really wanna help in any way possible! Thanks again for all your hard work. I can\u2019t stop reading these posts. A: For researchers a good way to contribute and gain visibility is to post quality content on ethresear.ch. If you are a developer consider joining one of the numerous ETH2.0 implementation teams. [Justin Drake] A2: Hi! The best way to get involved is to find something that captures your interest and to dig in. Because Ethereum is a radically open platform, the research and development is also generally very open and very accessible. Keep reading. Follow your interests down all the little paths and begin to build a mental model of the ecosystem. https://ethresear.ch/ is a great place to follow and begin to contribute to research discussions. https://gitter.im/ethereum/sharding is where a lot of the day to day conversation about Serenity is happening (developers chatting from various projects) https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs Read the spec! but not only read it, be an active reader. If you find an error, typo, bug, etc, submit a PR. Also check out the issues and PRs in the spec repo. We are constantly discussing changes, fixes, updates and anyone can contribute. If you are a dev, open up one of the eth2.0 client projects and pick a \"good first issue\". These allow you to touch the codebase, contribute a bit, get the lay of the land, and provide the foundation to tackle bigger issues from there. ^ Those are Serenity specific suggestions, but beyond that, just find projects you are interested in and begin contributing. There is so much to do and project leads are always excited to have helping hands. This stuff doesn't build itself :) [Danny Ryan] A3: If you're interested in Cryptography especially, you can also check out another BLS - Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham signature spec for Serenity and help to review it: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/bls_signature.md :) For research, as Justin and Danny said, ethresear.ch is the sanctuary. And first, you can take a look the various topics on Ethereum Sharding Research Compendium to see which area you're most interested in. For implementation, there are multiple topics: Consensus layer - implement the spec! P2P layer design and implementation - see https://github.com/ethresearch/p2p [Hsiao-Wei Wang] Q: From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside. Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)? For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse. A: Cross-shard communication will definitely be slow at base layer, however there are higher-level mechanisms that can be used to implement fast cross-shard communication on top of a base layer that allows any cross-shard communication at all even if slow. See https://ethresear.ch/t/a-layer-2-computing-model-using-optimistic-state-roots/4481 for an example of how this could be done. In general, I expect a lot of the long-run innovation in improving the smart contract development experience to happen at higher levels in this way; I write about why this is a good idea at length here: https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What happens to all the contracts currently running? A: It is somewhat speculative at this point. My best guess is that Ethereum 1.0 contracts will stay running as-is for a long time (say, 10+ years) without any migration to Ethereum 2.0. This can be made sustainable by doing two things: Lower the inflation (e.g. reduce it by 20x, bringing the PoW security to a blockchain such as Ethereum Classic). Completely removing inflation\u2014relying on transaction fees only\u2014would also be possible (see below for security argument). Use Ethereum 2.0 to regularly finalise Ethereum 1.0, counter-balancing the reduced security and preventing long-range 51% attacks. This requires Ethereum 1.0 nodes to be beacon chain light clients, which should take years to happen. If the community gets tired of Ethereum 1.0 a bomb mechanism (e.g. difficulty bomb, issuance bomb, gas bomb, etc.) can gracefully kill it. Another possibility is for Ethereum 1.0 to become a contract on Ethereum 2.0. I don't see this as a practical solution, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise :) [Justin Drake] A follow up: I'll add that if any specific user wants to migrate their application to the 2.0 chain, then they should be able to just take their existing high-level code (Solidity or Vyper), make relatively few changes and redeploy. The main difference between the eth1 and eth2 systems that users will need to worry about is likely to be rent (or equivalents like gas-payment-extended bounded TTLs). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there a worry that shards will become \u201cgentrified\u201d until full shard interoperability? Basically, will one shard capture all the defi apps because they can't directly communicate with each other on separate shards? A: I would say if that happens, that will create a large incentive for someone to create a defi dapp that can interact with the other defi dapps through asynchronous cross-shard transactions and launch it on a cheaper shard. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: At the start in times of low usage, the economic load-balancing might result in over and under utilized shards. Overtime as usage increases, I expect the economic benefits of deploying and interacting on particular shards will become more tangible and result in a more economically rational distribution across shards. Observing the emergent behavior is going to be super fascinating :) [Danny Ryan] Q: Can we run the same validator on multiple machines - in order to avoid penalties if one machine was compromised ? If yes - what happens when we run a validator on 3 machines, one goes temporary offline, one is compromised, one is OK? A: For small amounts of ETH I'd recommend just running on one machine; unless many other validators get penalized at the same time as you, the penalties are not too large. If you do want to decentralize your validator, then we have recently made progress toward validation being more multi-party-computation friendly, which would allow you to run a validator as a 2-of-3. In that case, as long as two of the three sub-nodes are functioning correctly you'll be fine. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Yes! Ethereum 2.0 is friendly to n-of-m schemes thanks to BLS signatures. For example, with a 2-of-3 scheme you have can three computers, each with a share of the validator private key, such that two need to be online at any given time. This improves security as well, because an attacker now needs to compromise two of the BLS key shares. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there tech from any competitors such as Dfinity (or any others) that is worth adopting into Ethereum 2.0, or is the work all other dapp/smart contract platforms doing not relevant/good enough for ETH 2.0? A: Part of the job of the research team is to absorb good ideas from research papers and other blockchain projects. I keep a keen eye on technically interesting projects such as Dfinity, Coda, Zcash, etc. Competitors definitely also have good ideas, and learning from each other is part of the game :) [Justin Drake] Q: Do we need to run a full node to also earn from network fees or would the validator client handle this? A: Depends what you mean by \"full node\". The design of the sharding system is such that no one needs to run a node that verifies all of the data of all of the shards. A validator client validates the beacon chain and the specific shards that you get assigned to validate, and that is sufficient to earn network fees. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: The validator client should abstract the necessary tasks to get revenue from the different revenue streams. (This includes being a full node for the beacon chain and one shard at any given time, but that's a technicality you don't have to worry about.) [Justin Drake] Q: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. It's also the thing that scares me the most about the proposed design;i can see how they would really increase the security of the random sample selection process in addition to RANDAO but manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? A: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. We're working our way with various partners, including Synopsys, AWS, TSMC, GUC, etc. VDF announcements to come in February :) manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. Right. The good news is that Ethereum 2.0 can launch just fine without VDFs, so we're not betting Ethereum 2.0 on the success of VDFs. The current plan is to have VDF hardware ready in 2020, but 2021 would also be acceptable. From a financial perspective, we may share the total costs (estimated at $15m) with Filecoin and other projects interested in VDFs. We are already sharing costs with Filecoin on viability studies. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? Short answer: yes, of course :) Long answer: the ethresear.ch post provides a bit of clarity on that. highly specialized hw always connected providing a crucial function to the network it would be a prime target for potential adversaries to disrupt or compromise Right. The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to be online for normal operation, and even if everyone goes down it's not a huge deal. The main negative consequence is that dApps relying on unbiasable randomness will have to wait longer than expected for the random numbers to arrive. [Justin Drake] Q: zk-STARKs are powerful and I have been reading Eli\u2019s and the others paper on it. Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? I know Coda is planning on using Recursive zk-SNARKs to shrink chains but the lack of transparency is worrying. A: I don't see what fundamentally prevents them from happening. Recursive [any zero knowledge proof schemme] just means using the ZKP mechanism to make a ZKP of the ZKP's own verification procedure. The main challenge in practice is just that these verification procedures themselves have a high cost (eg. there's 50-500 kB worth of hashes in a STARK to verify), and this cost multiplied by the ZKP's overhead is quite a big number. ZK SNARK verification is in contrast much more \"concise\". [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? In theory yes, but as I understand recursive zk-STARKs won't make sense from a performance standpoint for most applications, at least in the medium term. [Justin Drake] Q: What\u2019s the final scalability limit of Ethereum post Serenity? Gas limits per block? Blocks per second? A: The current design has a fixed number of shards, at most one block per 6-second slot, and fixed block sizes. This means that the data bandwidth is capped. The gas limit on the other hand will likely be floating, just like Ethereum 1.0. [Justin Drake] A follow up: Though in the current phase 1 spec that's sitting around in draft mode the block size is so far fixed to 16 kB, as keeping it fixed makes the code for proofs of custody, data availability proofs, etc much simpler. If we want to bump up capacity later increasing the shard count may well be the simpler way to do it. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why should anyone move to the Beacon Chain? How exactly do you envision the move to happen? A: Why should anyone move to the beacon chain. Specifically, only validator balances exist in the Beacon Chain. User balances and state exist in the shard chains. Validators will move to the beacon chain to seek profit by providing security and resources to network. Note there is a new proposal to have the beacon chain finalize the PoW chain during the transition period so the validators would be able to provide security both to the new shards and the existing chain. Users will move to the shard chains to participate in the new scalable, sharded landscape. We envision economic activity to begin to move over as the system stabilizes and begins to show clear economic benefits to the users. It is important to note that a user could choose to not move until the eth1.0 state is rolled into a shard. How exactly do you envision the move to happen? At first, this will just be a single directional deposit for validators only to begin validation. Once the state execution layer is in the new 1024 shards, users will be able to transfer eth directly to the shards from the PoW chain. In the long term, the plan is to roll the PoW state into one of the shards. The current most favorable strategy from our perspective is to fork the PoW state root into a contract along with an EVM interpreter. Users could then execute txs on the existing eth1.0 state by call the contract along with the merkle witnesses of the state they need to access. This option is nice because it allows us to cleanly deprecate eth1.0 support in the long term. [Danny Ryan] A2: Moving to the beacon chain is done by sending ETH to a so-called \"deposit contract\" on Ethereum 1.0. People would send ETH to the beacon chain to become an Ethereum 2.0 validator and gain financial rewards. [Justin Drake] Q: How much funds does Ethereum foundation have and are these enough for finishing Eth 2.0? A: The EF has tens of millions of dollars in fiat, and a bunch of ETH. More than enough to finish ETH 2.0 :) [Justin Drake] Q: How is the status of a possibly fixed eth supply at some point in the future? Do you think it's likely? A: I don't know about fixed ETH supply, but we may get to a point of decreasing ETH supply. Indeed, we are looking into transaction fee schemes that burn ETH, and burnt ETH may outweigh minted ETH. [Justin Drake] Q: Have you looked into hyraxZK. They are zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup. Any thoughts on them being used in the future as the sizes are still very small. The only thing is they wouldnt be Quantum-Resistant but the proof size won\u2019t be similar to a zk-STARK. I wonder what they can be used for offchain as well, especially in networking by producing a zk proof of incoming packets that acts as Natural DDOS Protection. Just some thoughts. A: Have not looked into Hyrax specifically, but I am totally not surprised that things like it exist. I'm definitely very happy with the progress the general-purpose ZKP space has accomplished in the last few years; the very concept of general-purpose ZKP is pretty godlike compared to what I imagined was possible with cryptography as a child. Our general instinct is to find ways to make it possible to get the benefits of many different ZKP schemes with different tradeoffs in ethereum. The simplest way to do this would be to encourage the development of such tech as application-layer or network-layer addons so that it we do not need an agreement at consensus layer about a single ZKP scheme that everyone uses. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: V said that there are no fundamental problems left to solve. Is this true for only phase 0? If so, how confident are you about the other phases? A: Personally I am confident in all of the current fundamental technologies for all the phases outlined so far (Casper FFG and CBC, sharding, erasure coded data availability proofs, proofs of custody, receipt-based async transactions, layer 2 for acceleration, abstraction, rent, \"stateless client\" verification). There is definitely still a lot of room around the edges for optimization though. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why was Hybrid Casper ditched when it looks like the Beacon Chain kind of has nothing to do with the PoW chain? or Why not re-instate Hybrid Casper considering its testing is/was finalized? A: Honestly hybrid Casper is a bit of a dead end. Actually implementing/testing it across all the clients would require setting up a lot of infrastructure that we would then need to throw away. The design was highly inefficient because of its \"implemented-in-EVM\" nature, and it turned out that we could not really benefit from the ease-of-implementability of being done in EVM because we would need to write a lot of special-purpose code to make verification of signatures parallelizable. So we chose the route that would be somewhat more painful in the short term, but significantly lower headache to actually get to a stable sharded system overall. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: I wrote up some notes on the deprecation of EIP 1011 here https://notes.ethereum.org/s/rJDrKoBOQ [Danny Ryan] Q: 1. Since it is a one way transfer to the beacon chain, my understanding is that there will be two tokens: ETH1.0 and ETH2.0. Right? Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? Gutfeeling: how much \"unsolved computer science problems\" for phase 1, 2 and 3 roughly? I understood for phase zero it has arrived at 0. Will we consider some kind of tax baked into the system to ensure sustainability of core developments and infrastructure? A: Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? ETH in the beacon chain would not be transferable (anywhere!) until phase 2. That will make exchanges harder, although we may see a futures' market. My guess is that we will see 1 ETH ~ 1 BETH at pretty much all times :) [Justin Drake] My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? The reward/penalty constants are certainly not yet finalized and could use more community debate and input. That said, the rate does scale depending on the number of validators participating. If the fair market rate is really 20%, then a lower number of validators will show up. If the fair rate is 2%, then a ton of validators will show up. The economics of staking will find the natural equilibrium. That said the main risk here is if we set the target rate too low and the equilibrium lands at a low participation rate (and thus low security of the network). Although ~2% (@ 10M eth validating) is not set in stone, the idea for a low rate is that a huge amount of ETH is already being held as a speculative asset. Any marginal rate of return on top of this already intended long-term hodling is a gain for the hodler. [Danny Ryan] Q: How would you (and or service providers) ensure the eth on the Beacon Chain is the same as that on the PoW chain and vice versa? A: Arbitrage is always possible in one direction by buying 1 BETH for 1 ETH. A key design goal of Ethereum 2.0 is full fungibility for ETH tokens between the Ethereum 1.0 chain, the beacon chain, and the shards. Two-way transfers between the beacon chain and the shards, as well as between shards, should come in phase 2. [Justin Drake] Follow up point: If you wait until phase 2 for two-way flow, you privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money. This will be great for those few (probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. Follow up A: y ou privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money The ultimate loyalty test :) probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. We do have a minimum amount at stake to launch phase 0, around 214 * 32 ETH = 524,288 ETH. So we're effectively capping the interest rate (will be less than 25%) and setting a minimum security level. [Justin Drake] Q: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? A: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? At least as long as you are a validator. Withdrawal times should be a few days/weeks/months depending on how many other validators are trying to withdraw. What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? You can switch machines. You need a copy of your private keys in case your machine gets destroyed or stolen. Another thing is the withdrawal key used for withdrawals only. Keep that one in cold storage ideally. [Justin Drake] Q: Contributing to Ethereum 2.0? Are there any projects which are some sort of \"under water\", like only few people working on it. A: I feel at this point there are enough implementation teams, at least compared to some of the other issues that are underaddressed. Off the top of my head: Solidity being compile-able to E-WASM Vyper being compile-able to E-WASM Thinking about research problems related to phase 2, particularly around account abstraction, asynchronous contract programming models, etc Privacy, eg. see https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-we-should-value-privacy-more/2475 Improving the state of decentralized messaging and file storage [Vitalik Buterin] Follow up A: A few more things good to work on: liibp2p implementations in various languages Doing security reviews of the spec prototyping account and state execution in eWASM a lot of work in cross client testing coming up in the next couple of months [Danny Ryan] Q: We have experienced consecutive delays with Constantinople due to bugs found late in the process on a comparatively low risk / simple upgrade. What work is being done to mitigate this on Phase 0 and 1 given how much more complex these implementations will be? (I.e. What testing, third party audits, other considerations are being taken to ensure seamless implementation/integration? A: As the phase 0 spec is moving into a more stable place, we are beginning to look into explicitly bringing in third party audits, academics, and formal analysis. In addition to this, we are currently laying down the foundations of cross client testing and fuzzing akin to eth1.0. You're correct in that the consensus/system layer of eth2.0 is much more complex than the single PoW chain so we are constantly trying to reduce complexity and simplify. This is a major engineering effort that will require many parties other than our research team to plan, build, test, execute, and maintain. I think it is a major strength that so many independent teams with a diverse set of expertise have stepped up to contribute. Note, one of the design goals in the spec readme -- \"to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency\" We're excited to see new efforts like the \"Ethereum Cat Herders\" and scheduled release cycles emerging in 1.0 and plan to incorporate any best practices and efforts into the 2.0 process. DePM (decentralized project management) is hard, but we continue to learn and continue to get better. [Danny Ryan] Q: How difficult will it be for 1.0 contracts to work on Serenity? Should developers expect to rewrite their contracts to account for state rent and cross-shard communication? A: Solidity can already compile to WASM and I believe it is in Vyper's roadmap to do so as well. These naive compilations might be inefficient (e.g. keeping 256 bit types in the 64bit wasm machine) so some amount of rewrite or utilization of optimizers might be called for. Beyond that, there are some unknowns that might change the approach to certain contract programming modesl. For example, storage fees might call for a new ERC20 contract design in which user balances are stored in separate child contracts so that users become responsible for managing their own storage fees related to their coins. [Danny Ryan] Q: What is the latest view on how the \"upgrade\" to Ethereum 2.0 will happen? Can you take us through the different phases/hardforks that will in the end enable the full PoS/sharded/WASM blockchain, and what each will enable? A: Eth2.0 is broadly divided into three phases -- Phase 0, 1, and 2. Phase 0 - The Beacon Chain This phase is the launch of the core system level functionality of the new PoS chain (the beacon chain). Validators can submit deposits, join the validator set, and build/finalize the core chain. At this point the chain will have Casper finality, an RNG, shuffling into the various validator roles, and simulate crosslinking in the (currently) non-existent shard chains. Phase 1 - Shard Chains (data) This phase is the launch of the shard chains, but only as a blockchain of data. (Execution and state comes in phase 2). At this point, validators will additionally build these data chains and finalize the each shard back into the beacon chain via \"crosslinks\" and attest the availability of the data. These crosslinks were already being created in Phase 0, but had a stub for the shard hash being finalized. In this phase, that hash becomes \"unstubbed\". Shard data chains begin to have some utility for applications that need a high availability data store. Phase 2 - Shard Chains (state and execution) This phase is the launch of state and execution of state (eWASM) on the shard chains. This is when users and applications will begin to migrate to Serenity and use it to it's full potential. Cross shard txs will be available at this point, and users can begin developing any number of \"layer 2\" execution engines on top. The above (especially phase 2) might be divided into sub-forks, and there will be a fork during/after phase 2 to bring in the eth1.0 state/evm into a contract. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm quoting James' article: \"This means there will be little reason to migrate smart contract code or users until Phase 4 is released, potentially in the mid-2020s\". Does this mean, ETH2.0 wont be usable before 2025? \"ETH2.0 designers do not know what the cross-shard communication system will look like.\" If you're so unsure about the features of ETH2.0, why is it being developed at all? What will be the advantages in daily use compared to EHT1.X? Why should anyone wait till \"the mid-2020s\" to use ETH2.0? A: 2025 sounds... unlikely! I publicly made the prediction (since July 2018) that phases 0, 1, 2 will come in 2019, 2020, 2021 respectively. Scaling from shards will come in phase 1 and phase 2. On the topic of timelines, for phase 0 specifically, ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses for phase 0. [Justin Drake] A2: I answered a related question here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeufhqb [Danny Ryan] Q: https://hackernoon.com/what-to-expect-when-eths-expecting-80cb4951afcd From the article above, this is what I understand as the timeline of Ethereum 2.0: Phase 0 will be available in year 2020 Phase 1 will be available in 2022 Phase 2 will be available in 2023/24 Given the above timeline, is it fair to say that DAPP's have to wait at least 4 years before they can run their smart contracts on top of Ethereum 2.0? A: Hi! That article is written by an independent engineer that has been following development so it is not necessarily our 1-to-1 opinion. That said, I'm only seeing the following in the article -- \"Which is to say, while ETH2.0 may launch this year, don\u2019t expect ETH2.0 to support asset transfer or smart contracts until at least 2020.\" I agree that assets and smart contracts won't be available in eth2.0 in 2019. At the latest, I expect phase 2 to launch in 2021, but we are building a complex system and can't say for sure what unexpected challenges might arise between now and then. Waiting until 2023/24 is entirely out of the question for phase 2 imo. [Danny Ryan] Q: With eWASM will we be able to write contracts in Rust and/or any language that compiles to WASM in addition to Solidity? Where can one find out more about that and/or potentially help out? Thanks :) A: Yes you will be able to write contracts in any language that compiles to WASM :) I expect specific toolkits/frameworks to spring up in the languages people are particularly interested in (e.g. Rust, go, typescript, etc) to aid in writing contracts in these languages. https://github.com/ewasm/design is a great place to get started. The eWASM team has compiled a ton of info here to understand the project from a high level. https://gitter.im/ewasm/Lobby The eWASM team and broader community congregate in this gitter room and I'm sure would be willing to provide more guidance and answer any questions you have. [Danny Ryan] Q: Hi guys, Would you like to implement an optional decentralized identity layer in the future? like an option to use DID's or something. so the user can use zero knowledge proofs for Dapps that requires some proof of credentials of the user. Greetz A: Decentralized identity systems are definitely very interesting, but imo out-of-scope for blockchain base layers. The good news is that it's a Turing-complete platform, so anyone can build one on top of ethereum (1.0 or 2.0), and yes that are teams working on different approaches to it already. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What is the one thing on eth 2.0 dev that keeps you up at night? A: In my mind the Ethereum 2.0 abstract design is a remarkably elegant/slick/simple design. I worry that we botch the spec with poor taste in some of the implementation details, or bugs that we miss. [Justin Drake] Q: How will the Eth1.0/PoW chain eventually be migrated over? A: See the bottom of this post https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeucd4f tldr, fork into a stateless contract on a shard [Danny Ryan] A2: See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ [Justin Drake] Q: What are the current incentives for a person to run their own beacon node? A: It is a similar set of incentives as why you would run an eth1.0 node -- mining, run applications (block explorer, wallet services, dapp portal, etc), hobbyists wanting direct connection to the network, etc. If you are a validator, you will receive rewards for operating a node and signing consensus messages. If you run some sort of application, it can be beneficial to run a beacon chain to directly sync the shards you need. You also might serve light clients and applications as a business. I fully expect some some entities to experiment with this model. If you are a hobbyist, you might just like running the protocol directly for self-sovereignty :) [Danny Ryan] A2: Financial rewards through ETH inflation. I think Eric Conner has a spreadsheet somewhere. See https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1070713152864583682 for example here\u2014numbers presented here likely on the low side. [Justin Drake] Q: How do the researchers and developers feel about the complexity of ETH 2.0? A: We're definitely trying hard to bring the complexity down! Examples of complexity decreases that we've made in the last ~3 months include: Switching FFG from the \"per-block finalization\" model to a simpler epoch-based model Moving shard committee calculation outside the state Replacing the RANDAO hash onion construction with a simpler BLS construction (and same with the hash onion for proofs of custody) Storing validator state change slots in the validator record, making each validator's state transition process much more understandable Making shard blocks fixed size rather than variable size (which allows removing a lot of boilerplate for handling transitions) That said we recognize that there's still a way to go, and many features of eth2 don't feel neat and clean the way eg. Nakamoto PoW does. I personally hope a medium-term switch to Casper CBC (see https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/12/05/cbc_casper.html ) can mitigate some of that. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there any work being done on reducing the size of the blockchain as it grows? A: You mean the current chain or the 2.0 chain? Since this AMA is primarily about on the 2.0 chain I'll focus on that. The beacon chain state size is bounded, and there are no objects that hang around forever; even validator records disappear once either their balance drops too low or the validators exit voluntarily and then the withdrawal and exit waiting periods pass. On the shard chains, we're looking at ongoing storage maintenance fees for every byte of storage, \"hibernating\" accounts that do not pay up (at which point their users are responsible for storing and maintaining the data needed to revive those accounts if they need them). [Vitalik Buterin] A2: If you are talking about the Ethereum 1.0 chain size there are a number of workgroups in place and some of them deal with decreasing the chain state or slowing down chain state growth. See: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-ring-to-discuss-and-coordinate-all-ethereum-1x-efforts/2048 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-1-dot-x-a-half-baked-roadmap-for-mainnet-improvements/1995 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/state-rent-proposal-version-2-rushed/2494 [Hudson Jameson] Q: Inter-shard transactions - how do downstream shards protect themselves against kiting exploits (A- B B- C C- D where the transfer A- B is later challenged)?? I can imagine kiting tumblers that might make this a computationally intractable challenge. A: There isn't really a concept of \"challenging transfers\" in the current spec, and if you mean plain old fraud proofs then the answer is that if a block that was confirmed into a history turns out to be invalid then the entire history from that point on is invalid and should get discarded. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: If I deploy a contract in ETH 2.0 will it randomly be assigned to a shard? A: No. You specify the shard you want. You'll chose based on proximity to contracts of interest, and gas prices. (Each shard will have a separate gas market.) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though initial choice is not necessarily irreversible; contracts could be designed to be yanked ( https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-contract-yanking/1450 ) from one shard to another, and I expect a lot of applications will take advantage of this feature. Q: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? Also, will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? A: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? A software implementation of the VDF would likely be useless for production. The current estimate is that a CPU implementation would be 1,000 to 10,000 times slower than the ASIC. A software implementation would be useful for testing though. will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? There will be a small incentive for validators to also be VDF evaluators. Other than that we're mostly drawing from external incentives (e.g. as a large ETH holder you have an incentive that Ethereum stays healthy). The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to do its job. There will be thousands of VDF rigs given for free to the community. [Justin Drake] Q: Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds and can they cause collisions with old contracts? A: One of the features of Ethereum 2.0 is \"abstraction\", which means that users can specify whatever signature scheme they want. I expect quantum-secure signature schemes to gradually become more popular. Burn addresses can easily be made quantum-secure. Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds Yes, definitely a threat. Ownerless legacy address could be a systemic risk for blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Would be interesting to guestimate how much ETH is at risk. Q: ERC20/721 standards' design sucks. Is there any idea or plan to convert current tokens to ERC-1155 like, efficient format? (Code isn't Law. Seriously.) A: I'm hoping that Ethereum 2.0 standards (such as token standards) can learn from the mistakes of Ethereum 1.0 and evolve. Starting from scratch is a unique opportunity in Ethereum's lifetime. [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Agree! There's a lot from ERC20 that I dislike, the main two things being: It being a pull system vs a push system, requiring the whole approve/transferFrom mess to use tokens to pay for things in smart contracts Handling of ETH being so different from handling of tokens Definitely would like to see both issues resolved in 2.0. The other big things I want to \"get right this time\" is (i) multisig wallets and (ii) not having the \"ether used to pay for gas to withdraw funds from a mixer contract being a deanonymization vector\" issue that makes privacy hard at the moment. Q: How soon will staking pools be live when Ethereum staking goes live? A: At the consensus layer we are trying hard to be friendly to decentralised staking pools. Hopefully we will see those soon after the launch of phase 0. The research and implementation work that Dfinity is doing regarding BLS Distributed Key Generation (DKG) will likely help decentralised pools. Centralised staking pools\u2014unlike centralised mining pools\u2014are somewhat awkward because you have to trust the operator to behave properly with your funds. [Justin Drake] Q: If we want to bring our smart contracts to a new chain, could we pre-determine the corresponding starting/ending hex values for the old smart contracts? Kind of reminds me of CREATE2... A: Yes, Eth2.0 will have a CREATE2 equivalent for deploying contracts. As for existing contracts, the entire eth1.0 state will be rolled into a contract on a shard and these existing contracts will be callable via calling into this 1.0 contract targeting the existing contract address. [Danny Ryan] Q: Are there any courses or subjects in uni that one should take to help in becoming a researcher? A: I'd say you need to be a good self-learner. Math, cryptography, computer science, programming, economics, networking are all relevant. [Justin Drake] Q: Of proposed ways to tackle state rent problem, which one is your favorite? What do you think about resulting complexity from user point of view? A: As far as base protocol goes, either option here: https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 The complexity is actually not so much in the rent itself, it's in how it changes the developer experience. The general approach is that application storage will need to be more \"modular\" and explicitly broken down into chunks associated with specific users, possibly with a fixed amount of \"global\" storage, plus some short-term storage not assigned to any user that goes away after some fixed amount of time, eg. 6 months. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Question for Justin Drake and other VDF researchers: Would using Chainlink and TEEs (Intel SGX) be a viable method of generating secure randomness for the VDF function of Eth 2.0? Could this be used in lieu of specialized hardware? If so, I imagine this could be a substantial time and cost saving measure in the quest for Serenity. A: TEEs can be used to generate randomness using delay. Unfortunately TEEs is trusted hardware. We need a trustless solution :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though I would add that trusted hardware could be a great thing for individual validators to use to increase their security. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What computer science problems still need to be solved prior to the release of Phase 1? A: For phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. Please message me if that sounds like your cup of tea :) [Justin Drake] Q: What happens to the beacon chain in the event of a controversial hardfork on the Eth 1.0 chain? Will two beacon chains form? If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? How will this affect the transition of the Eth 1.0 chain onto a Eth 2.0 shard? What safeguards are in place to ensure that malicious participants do not create unnecessary volatility between ETH BETH during the year long transition from phase 0 to phase 2? It is my view that this trading pair must remain stable for a successful transition to take place. A: If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? By default the beacon chain validators will just use the voting mechanism that's specified in the spec, and whichever chain a majority of the validators support is the chain that the beacon chain will go with. That said, if we want to facilitate a peaceful split, there is a fork versioning feature built in to the beacon chain to make replay protection very easy... [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why are you not doing \"proper\" research and submit publications to conferences? A: Not really an answer to your question, but Ethresear.ch ( https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en as_sdt=0%2C5 q=\"ethresear.ch\" btnG= oq=\"et ) does get cited :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: As does the Casper FFG paper! [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Let's say that I have some ethereum locked on a time locked contract, will be available after the 2.0 transition? This question can be expanded to all 1.0 contract functionality after the POS transition A: The Ethereum 1.0 will live on, even after Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. See https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ . [Justin Drake] Q: Thoughts on this tweet? https://twitter.com/zaoyang/status/1088001513459511296?s=21 A: Eth 2.0 is not really trying to maintain backwards compatibility; almost every part of the design is significantly altered, and old contracts will have to explicitly migrate over to the new system and in some cases rewrite eg. to adapt to rent. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What's your vision for Eth 3.0? A: STARKs, STARKs and lots of STARKs. Hopefully some nice way to achieve 2 second average block times. Extremely effective cross-shard communication, either at base layer or through a variety of easy-to-use layer 2 systems. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: See https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1072593728253104128 [Justin Drake] Q: In the future how will a really popular DAPP operate? Will it be possible for a single DAPP to operate across multiple shards? If not how will it operate properly with the TX/sec limits on a single shard? Will L2 solutions be the only option? A: A dApp would have to get really big to consume all the resources in a given shard to justify spreading itself over multiple shards. For example, Uber does less than 20 rides per second. A similarly popular decentralised equivalent would likely fit on a single shard, especially when fancy L2 infrastructure is involved (e.g. state channels, plasma, SNARKs/STARKs). [Justin Drake] Q: What is your take on the current state of finding consensus on randomness, in particular the current VDF construction. While certainly clever, I wouldn't say it is very elegant. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? More general, are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) A: I wouldn't say it is very elegant I'd say VDFs are a super elegant thin layer on top of RANDAO :) Is it the hardware you don't like? If so, would you agree that proof-of-work is an elegant solution? Then think of VDFs as being \"proof-of-work 2.0\": much better randomness at much lower cost. It's a paradigm shift from massively-parallel work to inherently-sequential work. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? I'm not aware of any unbiasable randomness schemes that only have strong liveness, other than VDFs :) are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) We will have an academic \"VDF day\" at Stanford on Feb 3 to work on open problems. Will you be nearby? [Justin Drake] Q: Shouldn't the smart contract stated in (4) have the ability of sending just 16 ETH for something as RocketPool v2 work (while some consider this to be \"centralization\" I think it will help a lot the average user and mitigate the risk of the average user)? A: You can send between 1 ETH and 32 ETH to the Ethereum 1.0 deposit contract at any time. A minimum balance of 32 ETH on the beacon chain is required for activation as a validator. [Justin Drake] Q: I see a lot of people talking about nodes running in cloud. Shouldn't ETH find a way to actually discourage this? If everybody is running nodes in cloud that means we have possible single point of failure, which is against what I think we are trying to achieve and what enterprise customers are looking to eliminate. A: \"Partial slashing\" and the quadratic leak during times of no-finality actually financially encourage diverse validator setups. Your potential losses are much smaller when your slashable message or validator down-time are discorrelated. Diversity in setup includes -- node software, validation software, local server vs cloud provider (and which cloud if using cloud), geographic region, etc. If a ton of validators all run on AWS and AWS goes down, these validators will suffer large penalty leaks. To guard against this, I should setup my validation node locally or on a less used cloud provider. [Danny Ryan] A2: We do have a way! It's called \"partial slashing\" and the idea is that, if something goes wrong, the more people did something wrong the more everyone gets penalised. So there is an incentive to avoid correlation with other validators, and hence avoid centralisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Can you foresee ever having to move Eth 1.0 to Eth 2.0 in order to avoid losing it forever? A: The current plan is to incorporate the eth1.0 state into a contract on a shard in eth2.0. Note that this will just be a state root and an EVM interpreter along with eth balances. Users will be able to call into this contract by providing merkle witnesses of the required state. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm a new developer looking into Ethereum, where would you officially recommend I look to develop with an eye toward future proofing? A: A key consideration to future proof your contract code for Ethereum 2.0 is sustainable storage. It's known as \"storage rent\" and \"storage maintenance fees\". [Justin Drake] Q: What do you guys think of the Avalanche consensus mechanism and could it play a role in the ETH roadmap further into the future? A: Avalanche is interesting to me because it's a fresh approach. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out with Bitcoin Cash. Successes there can be ported to Ethereum via L2 infrastructure. [Justin Drake] Q: Is sharding smart contracts theoretically possible? How would one go about that? A: Here's a trivial example: the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be sharded across n shards according to the first log_2(n) bits in the domain name hash. [Justin Drake] Q: How does eth 2.0 balance security across shards holding different amounts of notional value in them? For example if there is a decentralized finance shard holding a very high % of eth + other tokens, would the stakers/validators responsible for that shard have incentives to behave badly? A: The key security guarantee of sharding comes from frequently shuffling validators into randomly-sampled committees (known as \"crosslink committees\"). The hope is that this fast shuffling resists bribing attacks, in both the \"honest majority\" and the \"slowly-adaptive rational majority\" security models. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: It still seems like an inefficiency where you'd be over-securing shards with low notional value + under-securing shards with high notional value. Am I thinking about this wrong? A: Every shard gets security with the same notional value. Value (validator collateral) gets spread evenly across shards. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: Ah think we are speaking past each other a bit, let me try to clarify my concern -- It seems likely you will have wildly varying ratios of (value sitting atop a particular shard / validator collateral securing that shard). So for example a defi shard with 90% of value in eth economy sitting in it only gets 1/1024th of the validator collateral securing it. And an empty or unused shard would get same 1/1024th of total validator collateral securing it. This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? A: This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? Oh I see! Interesting point. We consider every shard equal, and provide high security for all shards. The breakdown of even a single shard (namely, an unavailable or invalid crosslink) would likely be catastrophic for the whole system. [Justin Drake] Q: Will the Beacon Chain require its own nodes? Is this basically a brand new chain that has only one connection to ethereum: Proof of Burn? A: The beacon chain is a new system level chain that houses the validators and manages their responsibilities and rewards/penalties. In many ways this is akin to the FFG contract and sharding contract proposals that were previously deprecated but the organization breaks clean from the EVM to allow for a radically new design and increased efficiency. A node in the future can run the PoW chain and/or the beacon chain. If they run the beacon chain, they can then sync whatever shard chains they want. The connection at first is just an economic connection -- use the existing economics and community to seed validation in the beacon chain. Beyond that, we expect the beacon chain to be used to finalize the pow chain in the short to medium term. In the end, there are a number of proposals to either fork the eth1.0 state into eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: How does Eth 2.0 account for DDOS attacks? If people run nodes at home on consumer hardware with a normal internet connection they can be taken offline easily with DDOS attacks or am I interpreting this wrong? A: It is the responsibility of a validator to remain online to fulfill their responsibilities and gain rewards. A validator can remain profitable if they generally remain online greater than 50-67% of the time. A validator's inactivity penalties are also minimized if their being offline is dis-correlated from other validators. This incentivizes to utilize different node and validation software from the majority so that in the case of a ddos attack vector against a particular node implementation, your offline losses are minimized. The validator's protocol level identity and it's node's network identity are completely decoupled. This allows for a validator to create any type of obfuscated network setup that serves their purposes. I expect many tools and best practices to arise for home validators in the coming months. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are your thoughts on formal verification of smart contracts? Will this be possible with Ethereum 2.0? A: Formal verification of smart contracts is awesome and super valuable IMO. Formal verification will be possible in eth2.0. I believe the WASM semantics are already available in K which will provide some good opportunities for contract verification. Opening up more languages by using WASM will also allow for utilization of more restricted languages that are more amenable to FV. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are some good cypherpunk books that you would recommend to people getting interested in this space? (Or just good book recommendations in general) A: I don't read many books nowadays. I mostly consume academic papers, whitepapers, podcasts, videos, blog posts, Reddit, Twitter, etc. I did enjoy \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel when I was an entrepreneur. [Justin Drake] **Q: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? How are you solving the fast state syncing problem if nodes need to be reshuffled around shards? A: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? By randomly shuffling validators across shards. Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? Right now crosslink committees are shuffled every epoch (6.4 minutes) and shard proposer committees are shuffled every ~9 days. Crosslink committees are critical, hence why there are shuffled fast. See this answer also. [Justin Drake] Q: You said in a comment some days ago that there are basically no unsolved problems of Serenity Phase 0 left. Which problems of Phase 1 and 2 are still left to be solved? A: The short answer is there are no big fundamental problems for phases 0, 1, 2. The more detailed answer is that for phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. For phase 2 we need to figure out sustainable storage. [Justin Drake] Q: Before Eth 2.0 Enhancements come in, what is the best recommended approach for storing private data on Ehereum? A: Storing data on Ethereum is expensive per byte. Infrastructure like Filecoin may prove to be a good trustless storage solution. For privacy, just encrypt the data. [Justin Drake] Q: Will there be any zk-snarks related enhancements coming with Eth 2.0? A: We are hoping to have a SNARK- and STARK-friendly hash function in Ethereum 2.0 at some point. Unfortunately those likely won't be ready for phase 0. At the application layer, WASM will ideally mean that SNARK-specific precompiles won't be necessary. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there some kind of roadmap for the migration from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 in layman's terms? For true decentralization it is required to get more people on board that understand the full process. A: I described the three phases here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeueuzc EthHub also does a great job at simply describing the path https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/ [Danny Ryan] Q: ETH token will not be transferable back after migration to ETH2.0 What will be the token ticker for the ETH2.0 chain native token? A: ETH\u2014at least when Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. Fungibility is a key design goal. [Justin Drake] Q: Where does new client software take lists of peers with their ip addresses and ports? Is there is centralized server? A: This is an implementation detail. Some clients may have a hardcoded list of \"bootstrap node\" IPs and ports. [Justin Drake] **Q: Do you have any final plans in mind about the current ETH inflation? A: Nothing final. Ultimately the community will have to make a tradeoff between low inflation and high security. See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 . [Justin Drake] Q: What are the odds that a fully sharded chain including state transitions is feasible? A: Very high. No fundamental problems unsolved. The tricky part is getting everything to fit together cleanly. [Danny Ryan] Q: Can I use a raspberry Pi to stake when staking is possible? And what do I do with it in the mean time? A: Nimbus ( https://github.com/status-im/nimbus ) is targeting resource-constrained validators :) [Justin Drake] Q: What's your opinion of EOS (or TRON, STEEM) in terms of dapp platform? A: I tend to be critical of that class of systems. See https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html and https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html for reasons why. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Any updates as far as overall inflation rate per year or per milestone/HF? Any updates as far as TPS per year or per milestone/HF? A: See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 [Justin Drake] Q: Can I make a Zcash coin on ETH 2.0 for example with all or most of the advantages of Zcash? A: Yes, there are already a number of experiments in eth1.0 to demonstrate usage of ZKSNARKs for both privacy and scalability. Check out miximus for privacy and roll up for scalability (both by barry whitehat!). Usage of ZKSNARKs will be supported in eWASM state execution so I expect more privacy solutions akin to Zcash to continue to be built on eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: Why is ETH 2.0 Phase 0 even needed as a \"main\" chain, and need Bether transform from real ether (hence risk losing some value), instead of doing a testnet only, because after all this is what phase 0 is, based on TestnetBEther? A: ETH 2.0 needs a main chain as a single point of truth for all the shards. The reason we have phases 0, 1, 2 is to break things down conceptually, and in terms of incremental releases to limit risk. [Justin Drake] Q: What work is being done to make the research behind ETH 2.0 more geographically decentralized? Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? A: Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? Once the spec is more mature I expect the community to pick this up, somewhat similar to how Andreas's books get translated. English seems to be the a lingua franca for research and development. [Justin Drake] Q: After PoS, if a node gets hacked, can the hacker make the node to lose its stake by confirming false transactions? A: When your validator gets penalised it is automatically deregistered to prevent further damage. We have a mechanism called \"partial slashing\". The idea is that, if something goes wrong with your validator it only gets penalised a bit if not many other validators also mess up around that time. So in the optimistic case of a lone hack you should recover most of your funds with your withdrawal key (kept secure, e.g. in cold storage). [Justin Drake] Q: Will contracts be able to pay for gas in Eth 2.0? A: That will likely be unlocked with abstraction (which includes gas abstraction). [Justin Drake] Q: Assuming the number of network nodes remains the same and the network graduates to full PoS... what is your expected maximum theoretical transaction throughout? A: Rough ballpark figures. 1024 shards * 10 transactions per second per shard ~= 10k transactions per second. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the most updated timeline for rolling out PoS? Since Vitalik already said 'research is done', what are developers' incentives to push things forward? Are there any specific measures taken to ensure a smooth transition? A: I expect the beacon chain (the core PoS chain) to launch late 2019. Ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses. Having the Ethereum 2.0 chain finalise the Ethereum 1.0 chain will take more time. [Justin Drake] Q: Will it be possible with sharding to have shards with different rules and/or technology independent from the other shards/beacon chain, but still using the same base tech in terms of transacting and security? For example: private eth network run in a shard connected to main eth network from which it takes just security from validators. Private transaction with ZKsnarks shard(s). Encrypted data shards. Erc20 like coin launched on ETH 2.0, but with it's own rules and maybe own shards somehow controlled by the smart contract of that erc20. A: Every shard has the same data availability layer, and the option to use EVM2.0 as an execution engine. That's common base-layer infrastructure. At the application layer contracts can be powered by non-EVM2.0 execution engines (so-called alternative execution engines). There's also a huge L2 design around state channels, plasma, cross-shard communication, etc. So at the application layer I expect lots of non-homogeneity across shards, as well as a lots of homogeneity thanks to standardisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Today, running full nodes isn\u2019t that hard, but the resource requirements are slowly increasing. How much thinking is being devoted to the greater infrastructure requirements of Eth 2.0 and how they will impact node participation and decentralization? A: Ethereum 2.0 validation should be sustainable from a resource perspective: Bandwidth: fixed cost (thanks for fixes shard block sizes) Storage: if not fixed then sustainable (thanks to ideas such as storage maintenance fees). Note that storing shard blocks since genesis is not required. CPU, memory I/O: similar situation to Ethereum 1.0 (gas limit that can be voted up or down). [Justin Drake] Q: How ETH 2.0 differs from ETH, and why POS instead of POW. A: PoS enables goodies such as economic finality and sharding. It is also much cheaper (in terms of inflation cost for hodlers, as well as ecologically) than PoW. [Justin Drake]","title":"Part 1"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#part-2","text":"Q: What do you feel is the biggest unsolved challenge left in Eth 2.0 research which must be addressed before Phase 1 or Phase 2 could be implemented in the future? A: I really honestly think that there are no unsolved research challenges at this point. It's mostly \"how do we make this thing more elegant and take up fewer lines of code and have fewer edge cases\" on the research side. [Vitalik] Better understanding the incentives and various actors that might arise in a stateless and highly abstracted execution model. There is really great work being led by both the EF eWASM team and the Consensys Quilt team to better understand the design space and active build prototypes to vet ideas. [Danny] Q: Previously, a release date of January 2020 for Phase 0 was informally articulated. Do you feel this date is realistic and achievable? A: Thanks for noting its informality. :) Launching early next year is my personal target, but there is a lot that needs to be done before then! We need: long-running test nets (however that is defined), formal verification of the deposit contract, and clients to be ready for prime time, but right now it looks like everything will come together in time. We also don't want to rush clients into developing buggy software just to be ready by an arbitrary date. If anything, I think BLS standardisation efforts are the most likely to slow us down. We (as a greater blockchain community) are trying very hard to have a standardised signature scheme for better interoperability between all the chains. There is a high degree of consensus on this already, but establishing a new standard is always a slow process. [Carl] The client teams are doing a great job and continuing to push the envelope. I expect exciting progress to be made in the coming months, but I also expect that the last mile might be long. Early 2020 is realistic and still the target. [Danny] Q: Are the researchers happy with the current state of the economics of Ethereum 2.0? A: I don't think it's productive for us to worry about the absolute numbers at this point; the network will launch, and either the rewards will prove sufficient or they won't. The other thing worth worrying about is centralization incentives, but that's difficult to work out \"in theory land\"; much of the result in practice has to do with how lazy people are. [Vitalik] Q: My biggest worry about ETH 2.0 is that it will kill composability. Won't most dapps end up trying to build on the same shard as say MakerDAO so they can use Dai? A: Composability between shards is definitely unchartered territory but there are reasons to be optimistic: The shards are designed for homogeneity (unlike, say, Polkadot or Cosmos) to facilitate cross-shard communication. There are design patterns which abstract away the boundaries between shards. For example, one could consider shards 0 and 1 as a combined data availability substrate for an execution engine which requires more bandwidth. These design patterns will be more easily exploitable in the context of programmable execution engines. The shards are designed to be friendly to \"fast optimistic finality\" thanks to shard attestations which are somewhat analogous to block confirmations in the context of Eth1. What this means that is, in practice, the shards may act as one logical blockchain thanks to quick probabilistic finality of individual shards. The UI layer is also an opportunity to abstract away the boundary between shards. [Justin] Q: When can we expect the Beacon Chain to be finalizing/checkpointing the Eth1.x chain? A: My best guess is early 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: Under the specs there is a \" block.eth1_data \" property; based on that I thought that somehow we were going to have an hybrid validation starting Jan 2020 (if all goes well) from both PoW and PoS. As stakers, what are we going to validate except the validators, staking rewards penalties if all the traffic will still be on eth 1.0 and we're not taking part? A: In order for Eth2 to finalise Eth1, 2 things are needed, Eth2 must vote on Eth1 (as is implemented as you point out) and Eth1 must change its fork rule to follow the finalised blocks on Eth1. The latter requirement requires an Eth1 hardfork. It is therefore easier to just have validator finalise the things you mention for now and later on add in Eth1 finalisation. Additionally, it is safer to launch without Eth1 finalisation in case of a Eth2 black-swan event in the early days. [Carl] Q: Rebuttals to the criticism that Eth 2.0 is extremely complex? A: It got considerably simpler over the last year. If you do a word count on the spec, it seems to be considerably smaller than the yellow paper at this point. There's a lot of things in eth2 that are much simpler than eth1. But there's definitely lingering complexity and I deeply care about minimizing it. [Vitalik] While the research path has been somewhat tortuous and hard to follow, the end product is arguably simple and clean. Expect more educational material highlighting the simplicity of the current design. Phase 0 is about 1024 lines of code to specify (assuming SHA256 and BLS12-381 as primitives). I expect phases 1 and 2 to be 1024 lines of code combined (assuming WASM as primitive). That's just the phase 0 consensus (deposit contract, beacon chain state transition function, and beacon chain fork choice rule). [Justin] Q: Why are there so many teams building eth2.0 clients? I understand the point of client diversity but don't you think 6 clients seem to be pushing it? Supporting so many clients would also divide the resources in terms of funding. Which clients do you see as the geth and parity of eth2.0? A: A few notes on client diversity: There's more than 6 clients being developed\u2014it's closer to 8. I expect consolidation\u2014a bunch of clients may not survive 2020. I expect specialisation\u2014one can focus on the browser (e.g. Lodestar), resource-constrained devices (e.g. Nimbus), the enterprise (e.g. Artemis), prototyping (e.g. Trinity), etc. A minimum of two production-ready clients are necessary for launch. I expect the first-mover advantage to be strong. All the above have, to an extent, historically happened on Eth1. [Carl] We definitely don't want a duopoly! For me personally, the ideal would be to have no single client exceed 1/3 of the network, so any software bug in any single client would not stop the network. Though having no single client exceed 1/2 is ok too and gets us most of the same benefit (if a major client has a bug, having no finality for a while while things are being figured out may even be an improvement...) I expect a power law distribution, and it's definitely likely that some of the clients will not survive to see significant usage on mainnet. [Vitalik] My guess on why so many clients showed up to do the hard work is that eth2.0 is both exciting as a purely technical challenge as well as a chance to make a mark on Ethereum and the crypto space in general. I'm pleased that there are so many great teams doing the hard work, but recently, I've been more focused on finding contributors to do value-add work outside of the core client implementation. Formal verification, academic analysis of protocols, testing, light clients, web3 interfaces and developer tooling, validator clients with great UX that plug into any underlying node, etc, etc. [Danny] Q: Are the Ethereum 2.0 clients eventually going to replace the 1.0 counterparts? For example, will Prism ever get merged to Geth? A: I expect the Eth1 clients to live a long and prosperous life :) On Prism: \"Likely not. Other than the language (Go), Prysm and Geth have very little in common.\" [Justin] Q: what happens when I stake 32 eth, and get slashed once? now that my stake is below 32 eth do i get kicked out of the validator set? A: Validators get kicked out when they get slashed. There is another ejection mechanism if your balance goes below 16 ETH from accumulating (non-slashing) penalties. [Justin] You also lose some amount of ETH. The minimum being set to 1 ETH currently. There is an additional penalty related to the number of other slashable offenses that have occurred in the recent time period. If more validators have been slashed recently, you lose more ETH. The maximum penalty occurs if ~1/3 of validators have been slashed recently, at which point you lose all ETH. This highlights the importance of having a discorrelated validator setup from other nodes and potentially having some fault tolerance setup with yourself before you sign things. [Danny] Q: What are the non-slashing offences? A: There are micro-penalties for not voting to finalise the same blocks as other validators and the inactivity penalty (for offline validators) for when the chain is not finalising for an extended period of time. [Carl] We have a bunch of micro-penalties for not optimally crafting attestations and penalties for being offline (search for get_attestation_deltasand get_crosslink_deltas here ). [Justin] Q: i hear a lot of hype around staking rewards, but what are the penalties for getting slashed? does the network have different punishments for different misbehavior (offline vs. double-signing)? is the \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\" still correct? A: I think you are conflating two thigs here, slashing and the inactivity leak. Inactivity leak If your validator node goes offline for 18 days, and the beacon chain is not finalizing, then your balance will be reduced by \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\". Slashing If a validator behaves provably maliciously, then they are slashed by having their balance reduced. Assuming client software is written well, this should be basically impossible to happen to you. Minimum penalty is 1 ETH, but it goes up linearly in the number of people slashed at the same time as you. See here for more [Carl] Important to note that if you are offline, but the chain is still finalizing you only stand to lose approximately the same as you would have gained. The quick reduction in balance over a ~2 week period only occurs when not finalizing. Another reason to have a discorrelated setup from the rest of the network! [Danny] Q:What is currently the most exciting new research development in Ethereum 2.0? A: The execution engine abstraction in phase 2 is quite exciting, taking account abstraction to the next level. It allows for the consensus part of execution to be an ultra thin layer of abstraction on top of data availability. Assuming WASM as a black box, it may be on the order of 256 lines of code to specify. There's an initial proposal from Vitalik here . The idea is that even the notion of a \"transaction\" is an application-layer detail which can be specified as WASM code. Compare this to Eth1 which \"enshrines\" an opinionated notion of replay protection (nonces), signatures (ECDSA), contracts, accounts (vs UTXOs), gas, storage, etc. [Justin] I'm lately most excited about this . The OVM work by Karl Floersch and co is along similar lines and also very interesting. [Vitalik] Q: Theres been some debate over the necessity of ASICs in Eth 2.0. I understand theres an effort to spread the cost out among various communities, but I think many people feel this might just end up being an expensive science project where the rewards dont justify the costs and if you itemised Eth 2.0, it seems like it might be the most expensive part. Are there alternatives besides relying on just Randao/Randao + ASICs (VDF)? What are the ELI5 upsides + downsides of the alternatives? I appreciate that the researchers are a tackling a difficult problem with randomness for a blockchain. A: It's important to stress that the VDF mechanism's safety is not critical to the safety of the Eth2 consensus; if the VDF scheme gets broken or someone makes an ASIC fast enough to predict all the outputs, all that happens is that the percentage of validators they need to corrupt a single committee drops by a few percentage points (think, from ~50% to ~33-40% plus a lot of computing power). I actually think the main value of the VDF is that it provides global trustable secure randomness to applications that need it. [Vitalik] +1 on consensus-layer security and/or performance gains, and value-add at the application-layer. The other \"promise\" of VDFs is that they are a new cryptographic building block with the rather unique notion of time. They can used for proofs of space, proofs of replication, proofs of history, anti-frontrunning, expiring zk-proofs, and hopefully further applications which are hard to predict today. [Justin] Q: I'd like to know more about the data availability layer of Ethereum 2.0 - particularly the economic costs of long-term data storage. Part of my political platform includes integrating blockchain technology with government operations. For example, I'd like to see all of America's public records stored on a public, open source, sufficiently decentralized blockchain. Would it make sense to build something like this on top of Ethereum 2.0? Why or why not? A: Realistically you would want an incentivized data storage platform like Swarm, with hashes of the documents stored on the ethereum blockchain. But I'd recommend thinking harder and trying to figure out how to answer the deeper question \"how could we use blockchains as a tool to minimize opportunities for misbehavior in government?\" Places to start I can think of include: Things like https://opencerts.io/ for all government-issued records Using https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413/ to do online votes, starting in low-security contexts (I think petitions would be a good place to start and underexplored) An internal-use stablecoin where only government agencies can hold balances but transactions are visible to and auditable by the public Some kind of zero-knowledge privacy-preserving sales tax collection thing Blockchain-based solutions for esoteric government things like spectrum auctions Get your country (I'm speaking generically to all readers here :D) to make an Estonian-style E-ID system that lets people make digital signatures that can be verified by anyone publicly. This is not technically a blockchain application, but it would be a tool useful in many blockchain applications [Vitalik] Q: I recall /u/bobthesponge once saying that almost his entire Net worth is in Ether (even his salary from the EF). Are there any other researchers on the research team that are as convinced of Ethereum's future, besides Vitalik and Justin of course? No need to call someone out. Just percentages, ie. \"Over 50% of the research team is heavily (over 30% of net worth) invested in Ether financially\", would be sufficient. A: Somewhat ingrained in our culture, the research team doesn't talk much about net worths. Having said that, the research team has a lot of fresh blood (e.g. Dankrad, Proto, Carl) which I don't expect to be crazy invested in ETH.[Justin] I am not an eth whale, but I get paid in eth and have high exposure. [Danny] The aforementioned Carl here, let's put it this way: financially, emotionally, and intellectually, I am heavily exposed to ETH. [Carl] Q: How many Eth2.0 client teams have to have a finished client for the Beacon chain to go live? A: I asked the same question a few days ago. At this moment, it is still an open question and will likely be until much loser to the time. Obviously having more clients is better, but that should be played off against the launch date. I am currently torn between 2 and 3. (Having 2 would be great because otherwise there is a client guaranteed to have a majority of the validator-base.) At the end of the day, it will come down to who is ready and when. [Carl] Two at minimum, ideally three. [Justin] Q: I understand that about 10 million eth is expected to provide good enough security for the network. In a hypothetical scenario, what happens in the situation where a large organization manage to secure more than 50% of the total eth staked and use it to maliciously attack the network? As i understand, the side with less total eth staked will be slashed, so won't this malicious actor be able to effectively kill the network? A: If a large actor were to aquire a large enough stake to take over the network they would need to buy 2/3 of the total staking supply which would drive the price up, so it's not a cheap attack in the first place. Secondly, you are not slashed if you vote for a minority chain, only if you behave provably maliciously in the eyes of 2/3 of the validators. One of the beautiful things about PoS is that these attacks can be handled with grace. We, as a community, can go in and hard-fork out the malicious actors so they have no more voting power. The malicious actors just burnt a lot of money to temporally halt a network. In PoW, by contrast, if someone buys ASICS with 51% hash power, there is no way to remove them from the system. [Carl] Q:Do the client teams feel their implementations will be sufficiently robust enough, stable enough, and easy enough to use that normal nerds (like myself) can safely run their node software, stake 32 ETH on it, and not be slashed or lose ETH due to client bugs? My biggest concern is losing ETH while being a well intentioned actor. I've ran Geth, Parity, Trinity, and EthereumJ (Harmony) nodes for multiple years now and those clients have been around a lot longer than any of the ETH 2.0 clients have, but they still have issues, still have bugs, still sometimes crash. A: I hope so! One key component in the incentive design is that penalties (for going offline and for being slashed) are only high if many other validators go offline at the same time. So any bug that doesn't hit every node at the same time should only cost you a minimal amount. [Vitalik] Q:suppose ethereum reaches 1 mllion tps, ledger size will grow 1 terabyte everyday, any solution to this? what is your projections in terms of ledger size growh and what is your solution to this A: The sharded eth2.0 is expected to handle ~10MB/s of data availability. This is data that is come to consensus upon in shard chains and guaranteed to be available in at least the ~2 week time frame. This is not necessarily state size. The current approach to state and state execution is to take a \"state-less\" approach in which blocks must contain the merkle witnesses of the relevant state to perform the tx executions. This is reduces the amount of state any consensus node must store, but does bring up other issues about state size, who stores it, how users get it, etc. In fact, the entirety of state execution is being abstracted away such that we can experiment with multiple schemes to deal with this problem (state rent, users/dapps storing their own data, etc). Much of the state rent research that @ledgerwatch has driven in the past year or so will likely come into play. [Danny] Q: Lets assume you are a guy with very little cryptotech-knowledge, but you do have 32 ETHER. Question #1: Would staking be made easy-to-do, so \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? Question #2: Does staking pose any risks of losing ETH by accident? Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network (eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise) A: Would staking be made easy-to-do, s\u00e5 \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? I expect a cottage industry will be setup around accessibility. Infrastructure to be built includes staking pools (centralised\u2014think Coinbase\u2014as well as decentralised one) as well as plug-and-play \"validator in a box\" solutions. Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network That's definitely the goal. eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise Penalties should be marginal for validator nodes that go offline for short periods of time every once in a while. [Justin] Q: What is the current thinking around the Eth1 Eth2 migration plan? A: The current approach is to fold eth1 into eth2 as an execution environment. In practice, this will mean that we would need to have a hard fork on the eth1 side to rebalance some gas costs (opcodes that read storage or read accounts would see their gas costs increased to 2000-10000), and after that at some point there will be a \"flag block height\" from which the eth1 state root will be moved into the eth2 system (or possibly some one-time processing will be run on the eth1 state to make some optimizations, eg. replacing the patricia hex trie with a binary tree) and after that eth1 will be part of eth2, with applications being able to run as before. I do think the likely gas cost increase of storage/account reading opcodes (basically the same opcodes whose gas costs were already increased in Tangerine Whistle; those costs will need to go up at least another order of magnitude) is something that contract devs should be aware and plan for. The reason that change will be necessary is that those opcodes greatly increase the size of a Merkle proof needed to statelessly verify a block, so currently Merkle proofs for a worst-case block are 100 MB; with those gas repricings plus trie optimization plus charging per byte of any contract being read, we could get it down to acceptable levels. [Vitalik] Q: Regarding Proof-of-Stake and wealth distribution (and issuance reduction), by the looks of it the majority of ETH will be held by the minority of entities, does that cause any concern since a single entity can run multiple validator nodes (and earn more rewards)? It's a question from inequality perspective not security; if ETH were to take a significant role in the global economy, wouldn't this widen the gap between rich and poor by orders of magnitude (MUCH worse than the current economic system)? Basically, economic inequality on steroids. A: I definitely think income inequality issues from crypto are an issue! It's a big part of why I am not a single-cryptocurrency maximalist. But I still think that PoW is not better than PoS from an inequality point of view, because although PoW does distribute coins into \"fresh hands\", you need so much capital to become a PoW miner that PoW itself is a big rich-get-richer mechanic in practice. [Vitalik] Q: I know its still early but are there some rough estimates of when we might see Spec freezes for Phase 1 and 2? A: Phase 2 is a bit too far out to say, but my hope for phase 1 is Q3/4 of this year. [Carl] That said, the current minimal execution design with EEs for phase 2 (once better researched and prototyped) is a super simple addition on top of phase 1 [Danny] Q: Please ELI5 (\"explain like I'm five\") why the need for a second chain instead keeping on evolving the first one? A: Building Eth2 on Eth1 would be a bad design decision for a few reasons: We would be constrained by the Eth1 gas limit, which would severely affect performance (e.g. 1024 shards and 32 ETH to validate would not be possible). We would be mixing the consensus and application layers. This means the consensus layer is subject to the application-layer DoS vectors (e.g. high gas prices). It would also mean \"enshrining\" application-layer contracts, which is far from ideal from a governance standpoint which should be as neutral as possible with regards to deployed contracts (i.e. The DAO interventions should be the exception, not the norm). We would be constrained by the EVM, which is notoriously hard to safely program complex contracts in. Eth1 does not have support for BLS12-381. We would be subject to the Eth1 block time Poisson distribution (as opposed to the regular\u2014and shorter\u2014slots durations in Eth2). The list goes on :) [Justin] Q: I am considering to stake during phase 0, but i am a bit concerned about the inactivity leak. I want to know how to stop/pause being a validator if I change my mind? I am asking this as there may be certain situations in which I think I will be offline for a while, and I do not want my balance to slowly leak out due to that. A: You will only suffer large penalties if you are offline at the same time that 1/3 of other validators are offline. Otherwise the penalties for being offline will be tiny, to the point where you will be net-profitable (not including computer costs etc) as long as you are online more than ~50-67% of the time. The incentives are deliberately designed to be forgiving to avoid discouraging amateur setups to promote decentralization. [Vitalik] The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Q: 1024 shards, 131,000+ validator slots... what happens if there aren't enough validator slots filled by the time sharding goes live? A: With 1024 shards, and 128 validators in a committee, a minimum of 131,072 validators are needed to crosslink every shard every slot. If there are fewer validators than this, then shards are skipped to ensure the 128/committee validator number. [Carl] The system can naturally handle as low as ~64 validators. In this case, security is obviously insanely degraded, but the protocol can technically move forward. [Danny] Technically the system can \"move forward\" with one validator :D But yes, below the 131,072 validator (4.1M ETH) level the properties of the system progressively degrade as the number of validators goes lower and lower. [Vitalik] Q: if i understand finalization correctly, the more validators you have the longer it takes to finalize. how is eth2 addressing this issue without pounding the network with tons of messages being sent between all the validators? A: Correct. I wrote an article about this fundamental tradeoff here: https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735 We managed to get a couple orders of magnitude more favorable tradeoff curve than other projects through BLS signature aggregation, which reduces the marginal cost of a signature to 1 bit of data and 1 ECADD (~0.001 traditional signature verifications) of computation. [Vitalik] In Eth2, more validators should not lead to (significantly) longer finalization times. By making use of BLS signature aggregation and by grouping the validators into committees, we're able to support hundreds of thousands (and hopefully into the millions) of validators. [Carl] Q: Has the EF given any thought to maybe issuing \"official\" NFTs (i.e. collectibles) to initial stakers upon the launch of Beacon Chain as an \"extra incentive\"? What's your opinion on this? I'd say this would be the remit of the community, not the EF. Note that the Eth2 designers avoided giving early validators a special reward (e.g. giving the first 16,384 validators a 1 ETH bounty) to avoid distorting the economic experiment. We want to learn whether or not the basic incentivises are sufficient to incentivise participation. [Justin] I actually like the idea of an NFT. The deposit contract is readable in such a way that proofs can be made to a separate contract to generate NFTs. Been talking to Austin Griffith about this. He/burner-wallet might take the charge. I don't think an NFT would hinder our ability to understand the pure incentivizes here. It's at best a trophy and of little economic value imo. [Danny] Q: How is the work on evaluating the feasibility of producing dedicated VDF hardware coming along? A: At this point there's reasonably high confidence that VDFs (including building hardware) are viable. A few updates: A team of 3 ex-Intel people (Simon, Sean, Kelly from Supranational) is dedicated to the hardware aspects. The Rivest timelock challenge (open for 20 years, designed to last 35 years) was cracked in a few months using an FPGA (see here, and here). There's also code on Github. Work by Erdinc Ozturk has improved the state-of-the-art circuit depth for the modular exponentiation in VDFs. The ePrint paper was submitted a few days ago and should be published soon. A prominent complexity theorist (Ryan Williams from MIT) is working on circuit depth lower bounds for modular multiplication. Significant progress was made by Ligero on the RSA ceremony. We are planning for a ceremony with unprecedented scale (1024 participants) in 2020. New research papers keep flowing in\u2014see http://vdfresearch.org The $100K FPGA competition is starting in a few weeks. We have relevant corporate sponsors for the FPGA and ASIC competitions. In addition to the Ethereum Foundation and Protocol Labs (i.e. Filecoin), a new blockchain project (to be announced with the FPGA competition) is helping with funding. $900K was raised in the latest round of funding. [Justin] Q: Is there a chance for obligatory anonymity of future validator withdrawals? Force every withdrawal to go to a shielded pool - like zcash does with mining rewards. I fear without the obligatory anonymity here just using a mixer/etc is going to be treated as extremely suspicious - forcing stakers would add plausible deniability. A: I definitely support moving toward more and more privacy being a default over time! I'd say validator deposits are more important to mix than withdrawals, as that way it becomes harder to locate the nodes of specific validators which seems like it would increase security and censorship resistance. [Vitalik] Q: What are the main incentives to run a beacon node for validators if they can just connect to high-up time beacon nodes?If there are beacon node providers with high up-time - how is this going to be decentralized? A: There is an anti-centralisation incentive mechanism baked in. Basically, validators get punished for going offline the more other validators are offline at the same time. So \"uncorrelated downtime\" should be optimised in addition to \"high uptime\". [Justin] Q: If, as a validator, I know that I'm going to be offline for a period of time, is is possible to 'pause' validating without suffering an inactivity leak? A: The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Clarification: there's a minimum ~1 day period before you can withdraw after you exit. It's safe to be offline during that time, but it does prevent you from re-entering. If we want to, in some future version we could add a \"re-enter\" feature that allows immediate re-depositing without waiting to withdraw first.... there's no theoretical reason why such a thing would not be possible. [Vitalik] Q: Do we have clarity yet on whether currently locked-down smart contracts (eg metronomes 4 contracts by Jeff garzik) will continue to work seamless in ETH2.0 or whether these contracts will be deprecated with all ETH in them lost? And how can storage costs be added to locked-down contracts in ETH 1.x ? In other words can we all assume immutable contracts on ETH1.0 will continue to work forever (provided enough people want them to)? Thx A: The current plan is that eth1 will be folded into eth2 as an execution environment via the stateless client approach, in which case, yes, contracts will keep working as expected. [Vitalik] Q: According to this paper, it may be possible for Quantum Computers to hijack and re-sign transactions DURING BLOCKTIME by (as early as) 2027. In other words, ownership of ANY wallet that has not upgraded to a quantum secure signature scheme BEFORE THEN can no longer be trusted AT ALL (even WITHOUT previous outgoing transactions). SO THE QUESTION IS THIS: Is anyone who fails to manually upgrade their wallets before a deadline (in order to become quantum secure) guaranteed to lose their funds after the advent of Quantum Computers? For example, if someone stores a PAPER WALLET for let's say 20 years, are they going to lose their funds by that time? Can QCs just monitor the entire blockchain and automatically attempt to hijack any transaction with insecure signature scheme during one blocktime, even if the sender has no previous outgoing transactions? A: Even if a quantum computer gets announced as immediately usable tomorrow, it is possible to do an emergency procedure to secure the funds of everyone who has not yet publicly released their public key or a signature (ie. every standard account holder that has not signed a transaction). You do this by doing a soft fork to disallow standard transactions, and replace them with a special transaction type that uses a STARK to prove that you own the private key k such that the given address A equals to hash(G * k)[12:] , and then moves the funds over into a new address type that uses a quantum-secure signature scheme, eg. Winternitz signatures. If we get more warning, then we can get people to update to Winternitz on an orderly schedule. TLDR: we're fine. [Vitalik] Q: how do/will the performance bottlenecks compare between 1.x and 2.0 A: 2.0 removes the disk I/O bottleneck for consensus participants by heavily leaning towards stateless clients. Finality greatly mitigates the sync latency bottleneck, and the requirement for consensus participants to store historical blocks. [Justin] I'd also add that I expect light clients to be massively more viable in eth2 than in eth1. About the same order of magnitude load as a bitcoin light client to stay synced (as opposed to eth1, where light clients are not light enough in practice to run on phones...) [Vitalik] Q: As an ETH miner, my main concern is how to prep for ETH 2.0. Any wiki, tips, or advice on how to proceed contributing (and profiting) for Ethereum? A: Eth2 has no mining. You may be able to put those GPUs to good use at the application layer with protocols like Golem, or maybe protocols that incentivise GPU-accelerated SNARK proofs. [Justin] Q: Approximately when is ETH issuance supposed to drop dramatically? (I believe the figure I've come accross is 10x reduction in issuance, is this correct also?) A: When the PoW chain starts piggybacking on the PoS chain for security (this could happen during phase 1 or phase 2), it becomes safe to lower the PoW chain reward by maybe ~4x. Further reductions would happen when the PoW chain stops entirely. [Vitalik] Q: During Phase 0, will ETH 2.0 be transferrable between wallets? 2.0 to 2.0? If so, are there concerns exchanges will list ETH 2.0? A: Transfers will probably only go live in Phase 1 at which point exchanges will list ETH2.0. Having exchanges to so will help maintain price-parity between ETH and ETH2.0. [Carl] Q: if block reward is X eth, and it is enough to secure the block, why do we pay X+gas to miners? Will this change? A: In Eth2 the economic security is not a direct function of the block rewards. Instead, it is a function of the total amount at stake. Will this change? Eth2 should have a partial fee burning mechanism (see EIP1559). [Justin] Q: As ETH 2.0 currently stands what are the odds of a uni-directional vs bi-directional 1.x to 2.0 bridge? A: The uni-directional Eth1 - Eth2 bridge comes with the beacon chain. I'd say it's likely there will be a bi-directional bridge eventually (though unlikely to happen in 2020). Even better than a bi-directional bridge (based on light clients, which comes with non-negligible latency) is native integration of Eth1 into Eth2 (see here). [Justin] Q: Will the issuance rate be enough to incentivize validators given the competition from say DeFi products and will it be changed in the future if needed? A: Compound rates for ETH are ~0.02% AFAIK, so very easy to compete with. The \"do you take 3% interest staking or 6% lending DAI on Compound\" framing is highly misleading, because that 6% is on USD, which is very different to having 3% on ETH. But over time I do expect interest rates on ETH to slide up as more forms of staking become available (eg. channels, Plasma, Truebit, other security deposit games...). [Vitalik] Q: What are the research team's thoughts / plans on if there is extreme price differences between ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0? I would think arbitrage would solve the issue but haven't thought too deeply on the subject myself. In paticular, if ETH 1.0 coins are worth significantly more causing people to not want to redeem their ETH 2.0 coins because they will instantly take a price hit versus just selling. A: I'm not too worried: Transfers and exchanges can be used to redeploy \"cheap\" Eth2 coins for validation. Large holders (e.g. the EF) can be arbitragers. The greater the price delta, the greater the incentive to deliver a two-way bridge ASAP. [Justin] Q: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? If no, is there any other mechanism to prevent adversaries that can corrupt a shard quickly from applying an invalid state transition? A: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yep! If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Looks like ~10x data (though very low computation, and we expect data to be cheaper than computation). But with techniques like https://ethresear.ch/t/layer-2-state-schemes/5691, even that could potentially be unnecessary. [Vitalik] Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yes. are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Now that execution engines are application layer, the answer is technically 0 :) For execution engines that use large Merkle trees (e.g. Eth1) the rough estimate at one point was 8x. I'm personally excited for execution engines that do Merkle path \"witness compression\" using SNARKs (proof creation accelerated by GPUs, FPGAs, or even ASICs). [Justin] Q: What is the current design to move Ether tokens on eth1 to eth2? A: That depends on what you mean by \"Ether tokens\". Validators can send a deposit of 32 ETH to the deposit contract which is then transferred to the beacon chain where they can begin validation. For people who wish to transfer their ETH from Eth1- 2, that is not something that has been decided upon yet, but there will (probably) exist a dedicated bridge for this purpose (otherwise they can go through the deposit contract). It is still too early to know about ERC20/721 tokens. If Eth2 has an Eth1 execution engine, then it could be pretty painless, but even if not, an ERC20 token could just be transferred by copying over its state root. [Carl] Q: Sorry in advance if my questions are dumb but I didn't follow closely Ethereum 2.0 for couple months. Is there an approximative release date? Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? A: Is there an approximative release date? January 3, 2020 at the earliest for phase 0. I'd say Q1 2020 is likely. Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? 32 ETH. Rewards depend on the total number of validators, individual validator performance, and the gas markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the typical validator has an annual return around 10%. What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? I'm proud to have been able to make a contribution in a beautiful piece of infrastructure I believe will radically change the world in a positive way :) Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? No. [Justin] Q: When sharding is released, will there just suddenly be 1024 shards in existence, or will there be a small but growing number of shards as usage goes up? Starting with such a high number will leave a lot of unused space/capacity A: All 1024 shards will be launched at once. Growing the number of shards is (probably) unneeded complexity. Shards with lots of unused capacity will have lower gas prices attracting more users. Q: How can the average person help with eth2.0? Donations? Documentation? Are there any organized efforts underway? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: After the scaling issues are solved will this be an economical platform to host backend logic on? How will this compare to running your own server or going through a cloud hosting company in terms of cost and ease of use for light or heavy workloads? Personally, my highest anticipated use case is hosting multiplayer matchmaking and signaling, though I haven\u2019t built such a system yet out of concern for difficulty and cost. A: It's unlikely that Eth2 on its will be used as a backend for heavy workloads, the data throughput is likely just too high. That said, it works really well as a dispute resolution layer so a centralised service can run the backend optimistically and if someone disagrees with the execution, they can contest and have it resolved on Eth2. For lighter use-cases it probably can, but this is more in the context of a dapp. [Carl] Q: I was under the assumption that ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain, no need to swap coins or anything but will this transition from ETH1 to ETH2 cause a fork in the community similar to ETC Ethereum classic and ETH chain? Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? A: ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Eth2 is such a big upgrade over Eth1 that it is easier to implement as an entirely new chain than to upgrade. See Justin's ELI5 here for more . Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? The large majority of it, yes. Rewards are also issued on the Eth2 chain so that increases the supply there too. Ultimately, the expectation is that all Eth1 ETH will be transferred to Eth2. Q: Do you think its worth laying 6 month/1 year/2 year 'ground rules' for Eth 2.0 chain assuming something unexpectedly goes wrong? A: My concern with doing something like this is its inflexibility. It is basically impossible to cover all the possible cases and even if we could, I'd argue that such an approach is too inflexible to handle the intricacies of exactly how something has failed. Handling it on a case-by-case basis seems like a better solution to me. [Carl] Q: Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? For example like proposed with Casper, every 100th block will be validated by PoS. A: The integration between Eth1 and Eth2 is a roadmap orthogonal to phases 1, 2, 3 of Eth2. Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? My best guess is this will happen in 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: What happens if you send more ETH to the deposit contract? Like 32.1 or 40? A: Nothing is stopping you from sending 32 Eth to the deposit contract, but you'll only receive rewards on the first 32 Eth, so it's not something I'd really recommend. [Carl] That's fine. Your balance will reflect the deposit, and the balance in excess of 32 ETH can be transferred to another validator (phase 1) or to a shard (phase 2). [Justin] Q: What's the easiest set up to stake let's say 320 ETH? A: A laptop should be capable of handling around 10 validators so you should be able to send 10*32 Eth to the deposit contract and start validating on your 1 machine. [Carl] A laptop should be sufficient. We'll know more in a few months when the numbers for block sizes and gas limits of shard blocks get finalized. [Vitalik] Q: What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I read you're involved in discussions with them, have you helped each other in developing code? A: I read you're involved in discussions with them I've had brief VDF discussions with Harmony. have you helped each other in developing code? Don't think so, at least not yet. What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I had a brief look at their whitepaper which seems to be inspired by Ethereum. So I guess my opinion is that their approach to scalability is great :) [Justin] Q: If Eth 2.0 introduces PoS, are there legal hurdles to be clarified upon? Could the token be considered a security token? A: I'm not aware of any jurisdiction that considers ETH on Eth1 a security, and since ETH on Eth2 is basically the same as ETH on Eth1 (other than the temporary technicality of two separate tokens) then ETH on Eth2 should not be a security. [Justin] Q: I'm planning to run a beacon node + N validators. Do you think this will will be able to be managed by a Raspberry Pi 4? I'm aware that it is being worked out to have ARM64 binaries ready soon, the question is if it seems realistic not to have a computer running at home and instead running something smaller and cleaner environmentally speaking like a Pi4. A: That depends on \"N\". I (personally) fully expect a RPi3 to be able to run at least one validator node, but we'll only know this when clients are closer to delivery. [Carl] Q: What are some smaller things that you guys would like an average r/ethtrader community member could help with? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: Is there any clarity on the transition process regarding basic aspects like whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example, and whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? Better asked, how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? A: whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example Beacon eth will be sellable on exchanges when transfers are enabled in phase 1. whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? That will come later, see here . how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? The long term plan is to natively integrate Eth1 into Eth2. See here . [Justin] Q: Can you explain somewhat precisely how cross sharding communication would work. As in how does shard node A talk to shard node B without going through some sort of intermediary? If they can do this talking, why can't it be used for eth to talk to say bitcoin. A: The intermediary is the beacon chain, or infrastructure optimistically predicting what will eventually get finalised in the beacon chain. [Justin] Q: How would you objectively judge the level of technological advancement of current eth and current bitcoin as far as the very limited function of sending coins from A to B is concerned? A: Eth1 and Bitcoin are comparable for on-chain payments. [Justin] Q: Presuming you agree price drives security, and presuming you agree all cryptos reside in a very competitive environment, are there any plans to address the increased issuance that the Beacon chain would bring? In addition, are there any plans to meet or maybe even surpass bitcoin's coded reduction of new supply to 2% next year. And related, what would you say to the criticisms that have already been expressed whereby if you can reduce issuance by say 10x, you can increase it too. Or asked in a more open question manner, what do you think of this process through which increases or decreases of issuance are made? A: It's possible Eth2 will cause net-negative issuance. The reason is that ETH gets burned via transaction fees. Pushing code to the beacon chain will also burn ETH. Finality, the penalties also burns ETH. [Justin] Q: Will phase 0 contain any scalability improvements? How many transactions per second will Ethereum be able to handle with Sharding? A: Phase 0 will allow for a light client that can give you hashes of the eth1 chain in a fairly lightweight way (but not too lightweight, you'll need ~200kb per 6 minutes to keep up with the committees, this will go down to 200kb per a few days with phase 1). This could be used to allow eg. light clients inside of browsers to work efficiently. That's a kind of scalability improvement, and an underdiscussed one imo. [Vitalik] Phase 0's purpose is tracking validators' states and producing randomness, asking about its scalability is not really meaningful. Regarding Tx/s, the answer is not really known. As a basic calculation, if each shard has the same throughput as Eth1.x, then we'll have 16 * 1024 = 16,384 Tx/s (assuming no inter-shard Txs). That said, the above numbers are kinda meaningless as Eth2 is designed to be used along with L2 scaling solutions like Rollups and OVM which could yield insanely high throughputs. [Carl] Q: Can you address points 2 - 4 in this tweet ? A: The default idea for clocks in eth2 is https://ethresear.ch/t/network-adjusted-timestamps/4187. There has not been that much work done on writing \"policeman\" software that would detect slashable violations by validators and penalize them, but I am not worried about this. Reasons: Even if no one writes the code, that just means the security model degrades to honest majority, which is not the worst One client implementing the code correctly is sufficient If a client implements the code badly, there's no consensus risk, they could just ship with badly written code that only works half the time and it would catch half the slashable violations. I'll defer to Danny on wire protocol stuff. [Vitalik] Point 2: \"Wire protocol\" = This is an implementation detail that I'm sure the implementers will agree upon soon enough :) The high-level recommendation from the research team is to use libp2p as the networking stack (dicv5 for discovery) and SSZ for serialisation. But this cannot enforced at the consensus layer, and we've already seen alternatives (e.g. clients using Whiteblock for networking, and Prysm is using protobufs in some places). Point 3: \"Clients to slash surround votes\" = Not sure what this means. The spec clearly defines the slashing mechanism for surround votes. See is_slashable_attestation_data. Point 4: \"Decentralized network time protocol\" = Just like Eth1, clocking is an implementation detail. It is to an extent decentralised (e.g. there are alternatives to NTP such as GPS, one can choose his/her NTP servers, one can use local clocks, etc.). It would be nice to have something even more robust but this is research territory\u2014not required for launch of Eth2. [Justin] Q: Why aren't Beacon nodes rewarded? Wouldn't this allow the network to be more decentralized? A: Validators are rewarded. Beacon nodes that are not validators are not rewarded in protocol because the protocol can't tell who's a beacon node vs just pretending to be one (eg. via 100 fake nodes pointing to the same real node). Though non-validator nodes may be able to earn money in eth2 through incentivized light client protocols. Q: In regards to the recent proposal of vitalik to use the bcash chain as a short-term scaling solution until eth 2.0 launches: is eth 2.0 still on track? is there a concrete demand for an interim solution? A: The main motivation for proposing an interim solution (if you don't like bitcoin cash for political reasons, I also recommended ethereum classic, I think it's also a good choice) is to make it easier for the work on building these layer 2s to be able to get off the ground in parallel with finalizing the work on the eth2 layer 1 itself. In general, the ethereum community is large, so doing things in parallel is its advantage. [Vitalik] Q: You do not plan to work on the creation of parachain (eth 2.0.) On Polkadot? I don't think EF will have to drive this. Web3/Parity are on it and I believe consider it to be a top priority. The Shasper (Parity) client is written in substrate to help facilitate this happening. [Danny] Q: Pretty basic but what's a realistic estimate of throughput after every is put together? A: Somewhere between 5000 and 500000 TPS depending on what execution environment and transaction type you're using. [Vitalik] Q: Could you say anything about the adoption of Ethereum Blockchain? Are there plans to create something like a B2B team actively approaching \"qualified\" companys? A: I'd say the Ethereum Foundation's primary focus is the consensus layer (research, development, education, maintenance, etc.), more so than the application layer. [Justin]","title":"Part 2"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#data-questions-with-justin-drake","text":"Q: How much data will there be in Eth2? JD: As the spec currently stands, on average 2.8MB/s across all shards with a \"burst mode\" which is 4x that (i.e. 11.3MB/s). Q: What does this translate into for state size? JD: At the consensus layer block size and state size are basically orthogonal considerations. Consensus-layer state size will always remain very small since we lean heavily on stateless clients. In theory application-layer state (\"L2 state\") can grow up to 2.8MB/s. For execution engines without state rent, you can expect state to grow roughly as fast as Eth1 state grows today. Multiply that by 1024 shards and the situation is possibly not long-term sustainable. This is a significant reason why I personally believe we should progressively launch execution engines (as opposed to allowing anyone to deploy EEs at launch), starting with an EE that has state rent. Q: What role do nodes play (versus validators)? JD: At the consensus layer non-validator nodes don't play any role. At the networking layer they can act as lubricants to relay message. They may also help create blocks for block proposers, i.e. be \"relayers\". Q: Who will run these nodes? JD: Nodes can be run by anyone who wants \"direct\" access to Eth2 (e.g. service providers such as exchanges, etherscan, power users). Relayer nodes may be run by specialised businesses. Q:For someone that needs to run a node (EtherScan), what will the resourcing look like? JD: They will get their data by being nodes and listening on the gossip networks. The bad news is that bandwidth should grow by roughly 1024x to keep track of all shards. But then again, that's not terrible news because a good internet connection (especially server-class) can handle 4 11.2MB/s (the 4 is, say, the gossiping overhead). The good news is that consensus state is minimal (again, stateless clients), which means zero consensus-layer I/O which is currently an Eth1 bottleneck. They can then choose withever EEs and/or dApps it wants to support, i.e. it's opt-in. Q:How do we assume all data is stored and available? JD: For recent blocks we have quite sophisticated infrastructure, including proofs of custody in phase 1 and data availability proofs (possibly phase 2). For historical blocks we rely on the ecosystem to keep them around. Q:What will \"historical blocks\" be needed for. As in, if they were lost forever, what would be messed up? JD: Historical blocks are required to recompute application-layer state, and may also contain application-layer receipts. If they were lost forever (which I don't expect would ever happen) then applications without at least one synced full node may lose user state. Q:Will people congregate on a few shards? JD: Hard to tell. Naive dApp design would suggest that dApps would aggregate into clusters within shard boundaries. We are exploring dApp designs that are somewhat shard-agnostic, i.e. consume data availability from shards as a fungible resource. Q:Quick explanation of cross shard communication and where research is? JD: Cross shard communication is a huge design space, just like \"plasma\" or \"state channels\". At the consensus layer we don't provide much infrastructure beyond crosslinks. I'm expecting significant experimentation in the early days followed by standardisation, somewhat similar to the token transfer design space and the ERC20 standard. One big idea is the concept of \"optimistic crosslink\" which are shared between shards in advance of the real crosslinks, and which with high probability will match the actual crosslinks that get finalised. dApps can use optimistic crosslinks to get super-low cross-shard latency. Q:Why 1024 shards? JD: Because 2048 shards would be stressing the beacon chain and 512 shards would be under-utilising the beacon chain.","title":"Data Questions with Justin Drake"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#resources","text":"Part 1 Part 2","title":"Resources:"},{"location":"other/ethereum-blog-archive/","text":"Ethereum.org Blog Archive Blog Archive December 2013 Bootstrapping A Decentralized Autonomous Corporation: Part I Bootstrapping An Autonomous Decentralized Corporation, Part 2: Interacting With the World Bootstrapping a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation, Part 3: Identity Corp January 2014 Slasher: A Punitive Proof-of-Stake Algorithm Ethereum: Now Going Public Conference, Alpha Testnet and Ether Pre-sale Updates February 2014 On Transaction Fees, And The Fallacy of Market-Based Solutions Introducing Ethereum Script 2.0 More Thoughts on Scripting and Future-Compatibility Cryptographic Code Obfuscation: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Are About to Take a Huge Leap Forward Why Not Just Use X?

All the ideas presented below are just that - ideas. We encourage everyone to submit their own ideas and start discussions around what can be done to improve the Grants Process within Ethereum. Summary This document was sparked by a recent Twitter thread where members of the Ethereum community came together to create a document aimed at disscussing ideas for new methods and processes that the Ethereum Foundation and it's community can work on to make the Grants process the best it can be for its recipients. The Discussion Main variables to consider prior to giving the grant Firstly, work should already be in progress. Is the project working towards an achievable goal? The team is recommended to have experience delivering ETH/DLT solutions Teams that are potential recipients of a grant should have a brief initial chat with EF to getting to know them, how they work and what their goals are. There needs to be due diligence to some degree. This also may not be necessary if a project with already completed work can be reviewed publicly. The Community (developer community) should be updated with their progress and kept engaged with learning material etc.. What can the Ethereum Foundation do to make the grants process better? The project\u2019s work should have already begun and the project should disclose what the grant will be used for. Grants should not pay for planning rather for execution. Once the applicant receives a Notice of Grant and the funds have been disbursed, they will continue to work on the project. Visibility into grant decisions and why certain amounts are given From a grantee perspective, when receiving a grant of certain amounts it would be nice to know why this particular amount was granted. It would be helpful for the grant provider to explain WHY the grant was awarded and WHY such an amount. It would also be good to clarify what is expected from the specific grant amount. Also, it would be nice to know what the projects have to do in order to potentially receive a follow-up grant etc.. Implement Checkpoints / Demos The grant recipients are responsible for meeting with the foundation grant team for financial reporting requirements and development updates. Disclosure of funds spent A timeline of use-of-funds should be announced prior to receiving the capital. For example, 2 full-time devs and 2 part-time, 40 hours a week and 20 hours a week respectively. Financial reporting includes: How much was spent each month and what it was for For personal privacy/security, there is no need to disclose how much each person received. An idea of what the rest of the funds will be used for Support/Guidance For funds usage and potential advisory: tips/advice on how to use their grants, such as if they should cash out / convert to Dai in order to cover their operations for X amount of time. Some ideas/options include: i. Multi-Sig where the grant funds are held in Dai/Eth This gives a transparent view of the distribution of funds given out on a monthly basis and to fund consumption progress. Perhaps one funding schedule announced by the team, they then give them funds? Clear usage of funds/transparency. The multi-signature wallet requirement ensures redundancy and prevention from accidental loss or theft of funds. ii. The grants process doesn't need to enforce an ideal situation because if a project is working on DLT tech you should be trying to #hodl crypto and pay your workers in tokens. If the EF transfers USD to a foreign account, the banks are going to take a fat ~5% FX fee/premium. If you're not running on USD and you don't want to hold ETH, the team may find it best to take the ETH and sell it at a local exchange (jurisdiction /legal dependent). For example, DAI is, of course, a solution to the volatility issue, but if you're not in the US you're going to struggle to liquidate it to local currency, plus you're taking a position on USD compared to your local labor. iii. As a grant giver, you may need the developer community or foundation to help out. It is what the project needs - some are self-sufficient and require very little involvement but others may need some hand-holding and need an army of internal/external resources. iv. Mentoring from the funding foundation to help guide the grantee. This would include reporting to the funding foundation on a scheduled basis. Where the mentor can chat with the team about the overall financial status and project performance of the grant project. Product market fit (PMF) - This section is optional/dependant on the project origins Implement regular PMF analysis and identify whether the portfolio company will survive in the long run and then assist them in refining their PMF (if it is not too late). This section is optional/dependant on the project because some grants aren't concerned with market fit. For example, many documentation or research projects aren't going to be valuable in any market. Encourage inter-grantees company partnerships and synergies When a company gets a grant from a foundation, they agree to work together and it should be a win-win partnership. Closeout requirements This process includes a review of the final financial and technical progress from the grantee, the grant lifecycle end. The project is then considered for a follow-up grant or the grant process closes.

Currently, nearly all documentation and resources for Ethereum are written in English. In order for the Ethereum community to become truly global, it needs to become more accessible to those who do not speak English. EthHub can play a vital role in this process. This page was created to plan the roadmap for translating EthHub into multiple languages. How Can I help? Join the EthHub discord and request to join the Internationalization working group Learn to make pull requests from the section above. To translate a page, simply navigate to the branch for your desired language and make a pull request on the page you translate. General plan This plan was the original outline for translating EthHub. Updates to this plan are needed. Target Audiences Spanish Chinese Hindi Arabic Funding Funding would be necessary to incentivize and compensate the translators. Strategy Translating EthHub is going to be no small feat especially when it comes to maintainence. It would be nearly impossible to actively translate every pull request as they are submitted. It makes more sense to create checkpoints or editions for the international versions of EthHub. This would allow us to carefully plan and review the required materials to be included and translated. Formalizing English edition The EthHub community will need to go through the entire site and determine what information needs to be written, edited, and reviewed before it is handed over to the translators. By creating editions instead of sister sites, we won't have to aim for a moving target. It may be appropriate to create a branch of the Github repo dedicated to each edition. Translating into target languages There are two ways we can go about translating the materials: recruit and fund each translation team or place bounties on each page and rely on individual contributions. Place bounties for translating each section After the English edition is finalized, a translation branch could be made for each language and a bounty could be placed for each section or page. Gitcoin bounties would be used to place bounties for translating each EthHub page, page section, and/or graphic. Individual contributors could translate each page and claim the bounty. One downside to this method would be that it would still require editors to oversee each bounty and review that the translation is refined. Recruit and fund translation teams Teams of contributors could be selected and funded to oversee the translation of the entire translation process. Milestones or bounties could be created to distribute the funding. The team members would also review one another's work.

Explanation Note: this question answers whether Ether fits the legal definition of a security. In the US, the SEC uses the Howey test to determine whether something can be legally considered a security. The test comes from the Supreme Court ruling in 1946 for SEC v. W.J. Howey Co .

People buy Ether with fiat currency, and many do so with the expectation of profit. However, the second two criteria are more difficult to prove. First, money used to purchase Ether does not necessarily go toward a common enterprise. In its current form, purchased Ether only permits usage of the network, not ownership to an enterprise.

Ether is necessary for Ethereum network security and operational efficiency for miners. Explanation The notion that transaction fees on Ethereum can be paid in-protocol by something other than ether (such as an ERC20 token) is called 'economic abstraction'. We explain why the Ethereum protocol is unlikely to integrate economic abstraction below. Economic abstraction is often used to argue that the value of Ether will go to 0. The theory is that users could pay their transaction costs to miners in something other than Ether. Therefore, if that becomes rampant, Ether itself would have no value. This argument can be used on any Proof-of-Work blockchain, it's an especially popular criticism against Ethereum since it appears easy to create additional ERC20 tokens that can be exchanged for Ether. Quick recap on how transactions work on Ethereum. Each transaction uses a set amount of gas. Users pay miners to include their transaction using a gas price. Gas * Gas Price = transaction cost. The base protocol assumes gas price in ETH and every wallet calculates transaction cost in total ETH to pay. The argument against ETH value begins here. It says that users could pay their transaction cost in some currency or token instead of Ether, including digital USD. Miners could then directly sell tokens or currency into the currency of their choice. While rebuilding Ethereum to accept multiple currencies (even USD) is theoretically possible, this argument ignores how digital native tokens like Ether or Bitcoin act as a layer of security for the system. Tokens like Ether reduce the profitability of network hacks by tying network security to the value of the network's medium of exchange. If network security gets hit, so does the value of the token transacted on the network. Imagine a rogue miner on Ethereum gathers enough computing power to successfully 51% attack the network and divert the network's currency to a personal account. If the currency's value isn't tied to network security (say, USD), the hacker could easily sell these proceeds at full value in reasonably liquid markets. This cannot happen with Ether. Other miners would see this behavior immediately and make it known to relevant markets for Ether. As a result, not only would prices for Ether drop, Ether would also become highly illiquid, making it difficult for the hacker to make off with the pre-hack market value of the stolen Ether. This argument applies for any decentralized blockchain, including Bitcoin. Practically speaking, paying with multiple currencies also adds friction, cost, and a UX nightmare to the operations of a miner. It would have to go through the following process: Open communication with a miner Manually calc the cost of the tx in that tokens value Send miner payment wait for confirm Execute initial TX and get the nonce Tell the miner the nonce and wait for his next block On top of the added friction to users mentioned above, there is an added cost to users to pay for their transaction in something other than ETH. Sending ETH in a transaction costs 21000 gas while sending tokens costs 40000 gas or more. Calculating gas cost and understanding the gas market is no easy task. Wallets have spent years making this UX smooth. There is no incentive for a wallet to streamline the payment of gas in tokens as the complexities are deep. Now let's talk about miners. Miners are trying to make a profit and have to pay for hardware/electricity costs. They do not want to have a portfolio of 50 different cryptocurrencies with wild volatility and no liquidity. This creates an operational nightmare. As mentioned, this is possible on all PoW chains. Bitcoin even has a tool that enables users to pay for transaction speed in payments other than BTC http://confirmtx.com . However, because of the arguments above, it's not rampant in BTC or ETH because it violates core security assumptions and has extreme practical limitations for miners.

Answer No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices. Explanation Basics of a transaction There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question. First, it's essential to understand how an Ethereum transaction works. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is a unit used to measure the computational power required to process the transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners expect to be compensated. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Fee market Currently, the Ethereum network is working at or near capacity. This means that a fee market is created because some users may be willing to pay more to get to the front of the line while others may not be in as big of a rush. Tools such as EthGasStation offer a great view into the current fee market and what it current costs to get a basic or fast transaction through. You'll notice that so far, we haven't talked about fiat or the cost of a transaction in fiat value. That's because at its core, the fee market is independent from the cost of Ether. Users have the ability to send a transaction from 0 gas price all the way to as high as they'd like and miners have the ability to accept the same range. Rising and falling Ether price While the gas market by design is purely Ether related, it'd be misleading to not acknowledge that a lot of users and miners think of their fees in fiat terms. So while the above example may have cost 0.000021 ETH, some users will instead think of that in terms of fiat cost ($0.002793 for instance). This means that the fee market, while independent of fiat prices at its core, will react to moves in Ether prices. If we use the example above and assume price spikes 5x, all of a sudden that transaction will cost $0.0139 in fiat terms. When price spikes (assuming network demand stays the same), users will start to lower their gas price. When price falls (assuming network demand stays the same), miners will start to raise their minimum accepted gas. We can see the fluctuation in average gas price in the past. Network demand As previously mentioned, network demand plays a much larger role on gas price than Ether price. If no one was using the network, gas prices paid would be near 0. If the network is full, gas prices will start to spike. This is an important consideration when trying to draw conclusions between Ether price and gas prices paid.","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises","text":"","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#answer","text":"No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices.","title":"Answer  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#explanation","text":"","title":"Explanation  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#basics-of-a-transaction","text":"There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question.

Answer No. Please check here for the latest size. Explanation As Afri Schoedon points out in his article , the Ethereum state is what is bloated, not the chain. So what sync mode should you run to get a full Ethereum blockchain with all necessary security? Both Parity and Geth offer options which synchronize a full node starting at the genesis block and executing all transactions. The modes are: parity --no-warp geth --syncmode full These are full nodes because they: Sync the full chain from genesis block Replay all transactions Execute all contracts Recompute the state of each block Keep all historical blocks on disk Keep the most recent state and prunes ancient states When running the full node described above, you are able to rebuild any historical information you want using just your node. There is often much confusion around if a state pruned Ethereum node (above) is a full node and the answer is yes. Pruning ancient state is fine as it is not necessary to most users. If you are looking to run a block explorer or do deep analysis on the blockchain, then you could run an archive node with no pruning so you don't have to always recompute the pruned state.

Both Parity and Geth offer options which synchronize a full node starting at the genesis block and executing all transactions. The modes are: parity --no-warp geth --syncmode full These are full nodes because they: Sync the full chain from genesis block Replay all transactions Execute all contracts Recompute the state of each block Keep all historical blocks on disk Keep the most recent state and prunes ancient states When running the full node described above, you are able to rebuild any historical information you want using just your node. There is often much confusion around if a state pruned Ethereum node (above) is a full node and the answer is yes. Pruning ancient state is fine as it is not necessary to most users. If you are looking to run a block explorer or do deep analysis on the blockchain, then you could run an archive node with no pruning so you don't have to always recompute the pruned state. Also note that you can run both Geth and Parity by default (warp and fast sync enabled) and you'll be able to serve the network as a full node after initial sync.","title":"Explanation"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/why-do-you-have-to-pay-to-use-ethereum/","text":"Why do you have to pay to use Ethereum?

You're in the right place! This guide will walk you through the necessary steps of getting onboarded to the Ethereum network. Buy ETH In order to interact with the Ethereum network, you will need to own Ether (ETH). The easiest way to acquire ETH is to buy it on Coinbase. One important note is that you do not need to buy 1 full ETH. Ether is divisible down to 18 decimal places so you can buy fractions of it. Setup MetaMask Now that you have ETH, you will want to send it to a wallet of your choice to store it and use it on the network. Wallets setup accounts for you which are randomly generated 42 character long addresses starting with 0x. Accounts allow you to store and use ETH by generating transactions on the Ethereum network. We recommend first moving your ETH to the MetaMask wallet . MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum dapps inside of Chrome, Brave, Firefox or Opera. MetaMask has a nice video to help you get setup: After MetaMask is setup, you now have your own wallet address (0x......). You can go to Coinbase and send your acquired ETH to your new wallet address. This should take about a minute and you will see the ETH show up in your MetaMask wallet. Setup Mobile Wallet (optional) Every Ethereum account can be restored via a random string of words. In the MetaMask setup above this was referred to as the seed phrase. It is possible to have this same account in multiple different wallets, including mobile wallets . We recommend downloading Coinbase Wallet , clicking restore and typing in your seed phrase. Your wallet is now also mobilized! Try Ethereum Applications Now that you have ETH in a wallet of your own, you can use any of the amazing applications (sometimes referred to as dapps) that have been built on Ethereum. There are many different types of applications built on Ethereum but here are a few suggestions to get started: Decentralized Finance Compound : Lend and borrow ETH or other tokens. Uniswap : Easily trade your ETH for other tokens. Games CryptoKitties : Collect and breed digital cats. Gods Unchained : Free-to-play digital trading card game built on Ethereum. Collectibles OpenSea : Buy, sell and discover rare digital items. Origin Protocol : Decentralized marketplaces on the blockchain. Other ENS : Buy an ENS name to give your address a more human readable format (myetheraddress.eth). PoolTogether : Join a no-loss lottery for a chance to win a prize. Long term storage As you continue to use Ethereum, you might start to acquire more ETH and other tokens. It is highly recommended to store larger amounts of crypto in solutions such as hardware wallets and smart contract wallets which are more secure than basic account wallets. Hardware wallets are the most-secure method for accessing your funds while online, as they do not expose your private key to the internet when signing transactions. Smart contract wallets are wallets with unique abilities due to the power of smart contract functionality. They enable additional security and recovery features for users.","title":"Ethereum New User Guide"},{"location":"using-ethereum/ethereum-new-user-guide/#ethereum-new-user-guide","text":"New to Ethereum?

Mining is the process of creating a block of transactions to be added to the Ethereum blockchain. Miners essentially process pending transactions and are awarded block rewards in the form of Ether, the Ethereum network's native currency, for each block generated. Generating a block requires intensive computational work (or hashing power) due to the difficulty set by the Ethereum network protocol. This difficulty level is proportional to the total amount of computational power (also known as the total hashrate of the network) being used to mine Ethereum and serves as a way to secure the network from attacks as well as tuning the speed at which blocks (and block rewards) are generated. This system of using hashing power generated by costly computer hardware is known as Proof of Work (PoW). Who can become a miner on the Ethereum network? Technically, anyone is able to mine on the Ethereum network using their computer. However, not everyone is able to mine Ether profitably. In most cases, miners must purchase dedicated computer hardware in order to mine profitably. While it is true anyone can run the mining software on their computer, it is unlikely that the average computer would be able to earn enough block rewards to cover the associated costs of mining (See question below for more details). What are the costs associated with mining? Potential costs of the hardware necessary to build and maintain a mining rig Electrical cost of powering the mining rig If you are mining in a pool, mining pools fees typically charge a flat % fee of each block generated by the pool Potential cost of equipment to support mining rig (ventilation, energy monitoring, electrical wiring, etc.) Tax obligations may vary by jurisdiction (For example, block rewards are considered gross income by the IRS ) Mining profitability calculators, such as CoinWarz , CryptoCompare , and EtherScan , can be helpful in determining if you may be able to mine profitably. Note that mining calculators may not 100% accurate and it may be useful to compare and contrast several results. Where can I find the latest information on mining? /r/EtherMining Subreddit How much longer will Ethereum mining be around? See Serenity phases for more information. Block Generation Block structure A block consists a header, which includes information identifying the block and linking it to the rest of the chain, and a body of transactions. Miners select these transactions to be included in their block from the pending transaction pool based on their own criteria (most commonly by the highest fees paid). Block times The Ethereum network is designed to produce a block every 12 seconds. Block times will vary based upon how long it takes miners to generate a hash that meets the required mining difficulty at that moment. 12 seconds was chosen as a time that is as fast as possible, but is at the same time substantially longer than network latency. A 2013 paper by Decker and Wattenhofer in Zurich measured Bitcoin network latency and determined that 12.6 seconds is the time it takes for a new block to propagate to 95% of nodes. The goal of the 12 second design is to allow the network to propagate blocks as fast as possible without causing miners to find a significant number of stale blocks. Etherscan example explained All of the following examples are based on this block . Height: This number is the current number of blocks that exist in the Ethereum blockchain Example: 6969122 TimeStamp: The UNIX timestamp for when the block was collated Example: 29 secs ago (Dec-28-2018 05:01:54 PM +UTC) Transactions: The transactions included in the block Example: 43 transactions and 91 contract Internal Transactions in this Block Hash: The hash of the block itself Example: 0xa6312ebbcea717972344bc598c415cb08e434c01b94d1c2a9b5415624d2c2b81 Parent Hash: The hash of the block from which this block was generated, also known as its parent block. Example: 0xa48e2ad13de011f127b345a81a91933d221f5a60d45852e7d7c2b5a07fda9fe2 Sha3Uncles: A SHA3 hash of the uncle block data included in the block Example: 0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347 Mined By: The address of who mined the block and received the block reward Example: 0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c (SparkPool) in 2 secs Difficulty: A number that represents the difficulty required to mine this block Example: 2,511,265,102,818,605 Total Difficulty: A number that represents the total mining difficulty of the chain up until this block Example: 8,470,035,190,867,378,349,872 Size: The size of the block file in bytes Example: 13160 bytes Gas Used: The total amount of gas used by all the transactions included in this block Example: 7,997,769 (99.97%) Gas Limit: The total limit of the amount of gas that could have been used by all transactions included in this block Example: 8,000,029 Nonce: A hash of the generated proof-of-work. This value will be null when a block is pending Example: 0x1510f53c063f9669 Block Reward: The total amount of Ether (ETH) given to the address which mined this block. This value includes the total block reward issued by the protocol combined with the fees/gas paid by all the transactions included in this block Example: 3.032755182184797136 Ether (3 + 0.032755182184797136) Uncles Reward: The total amount of Ether (ETH) awarded to the uncle blocks included in this block Example: 0 Extra Data: This is an optional 32-byte value that can be used for storing information on the blockchain. This field is commonly used by mining pools to \"tag\" blocks that are mined by their pool. Example: sparkpool-eth-cn-hz2 (Hex:0x737061726b706f6f6c2d6574682d636e2d687a32) Uncle Blocks Uncle blocks are stale blocks that are included in the calculation of which chain is the \"longest\"; that is to say, not just the parent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale descendants of the block's ancestor (in Ethereum jargon, \"uncles\") are added to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof of work backing it. Block rewards are given to stales: a stale block receives 87.5% of its base reward, and the nephew that includes the stale block receives the remaining 12.5%. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncles. Ethereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only goes down seven levels. Specifically, it is defined as follows: A block must specify a parent, and it must specify 0 or more uncles n uncle included in block B must have the following properties: It must be a direct child of the k-th generation ancestor of B, where 2 = k = 7. It cannot be an ancestor of B An uncle must be a valid block header, but does not need to be a previously verified or even valid block An uncle must be different from all uncles included in previous blocks and all other uncles included in the same block (non-double-inclusion) For every uncle U in block B, the miner of B gets an additional 3.125% added to its coinbase reward and the miner of U gets 93.75% of a standard coinbase reward. This limited version of GHOST, with uncles includable only up to 7 generations, was used for two reasons. First, unlimited GHOST would include too many complications into the calculation of which uncles for a given block are valid. Second, unlimited GHOST with compensation as used in Ethereum removes the incentive for a miner to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public attacker.

All state can be derived from a full node. Once fully synced, stores all state moving forward similar to archive nodes (more below). Client settings geth The default sync mode. Synchronizes a full node doing a fast synchronization by downloading the entire state database, requesting the headers first, and filling in block bodies and receipts afterward. Once the fast sync reaches the best block of the Ethereum network, it switches to full sync mode. geth --syncmode full Synchronizes a full node starting at genesis, verifying all blocks and executing all transactions. This mode is a bit slower than the fast sync mode but comes with increased security. parity The default sync mode. Synchronizes a full Ethereum node using warp synchronization mode by downloading a snapshot of the 30,000 best blocks and the latest state database. Once the snapshot is restored, the client switches to full sync and ancient blocks are synchronized from the network in background. A parity default node serves the network as a full node after it has finished synchronizing. parity --no-warp Synchronizes a full node starting at genesis, verifying all blocks and executing all transactions. This mode is a bit slower than the warp sync mode but comes with increased security. Both geth full and parity no-warp are to be considered a full Ethereum node because: It runs a full blockchain synchronization starting at genesis. It replays all transactions and executes all contracts. It recomputes the state for each block. It keeps all historical blocks on the disk. It keeps the most recent states on the disk and prunes ancient states. Light nodes A light node: Stores the header chain and requests everything else on demand. Can verify the validity of the data against the state roots in the block headers. Light nodes are useful for low capacity devices, such as embedded devices or mobile phones, which can't afford to store multiple dozen Gigabytes of blockchain data. Client settings geth --syncmode light Waits for around 200 seconds before beginning to sync from 2,300 blocks in the past, then periodically receives small bundles of 1 to 10 blocks. The initial sync takes very little time. parity --light Begins syncing from a hardcoded value (block #6219777) almost immediately, at a rate of approximately 23,500 blocks per minute. With a height at 6,500,000, this takes 15 minutes. Once synced, the light node receives blocks as they get mined and validated by full nodes. parity --light --no-hardcoded-sync Same as --light but syncs from genesis block. Connecting Parity light node to MetaMask (MacOS) Download homebrew (you will have to go through apple dev terms first) Find and open the application Terminal (utilties/terminal) Enter the following commands one by one into the Terminal: brew tap paritytech/paritytech (this adds parity to list of brew taps) brew install parity (installs parity - stable version) parity --light --jsonrpc-cors=\"chrome-extension://nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn\" (syncs light node, connects to peers and imports blockheaders) Press ctrl+C and then type: tail -f nohup.out (this will show you logs to ensure its all working) Open metamask on web browser, drop down network, connect to localhost. Archive Nodes An archive node: Stores everything kept in the full node. Also builds an archive of historical states. Archive nodes are only necessary if you want to check the state of an account at any given block height. For example, if you wanted to know the Ether balance an account had at block #4,000,000, you would need to run and query an archive node. They are commonly only used for services such as block explorers and infrastructure providers like Infura. They are use case dependent and have no impact on the security or trust model of the blockchain. Client Settings geth --syncmode full --gcmode archive Synchronizes an archive node starting at genesis, thoroughly verifying all blocks, executing all transactions, and writing all intermediate states to disk (\"archive\"). In Geth, this is called gcmode which refers to the concept of garbage collection . Setting it to archive basically turns it off. parity --no-warp --pruning archive Synchronizes an archive node starting at genesis, thoroughly verifying all blocks, executing all transactions, and writing all intermediate states to disk (\"archive\"). In Parity, this is called pruning which refers to the concept of state trie pruning . Setting it to archive basically turns it off. Hardware A consumer-grade laptop will be enough to run a full node, but not an archive node. An archive node does need 2+ TB of disk space, and that disk space cannot be HDD - it must be SSD for both full and archive nodes. Light nodes run fine on SD cards and HDDs. If a full node goes offline for a while, its data can get corrupted and it can take a while to restore it. For best results, if running your own node, run it on an always-on always-connected device for minimal downtime and maximum reliability. This can be impossible on a laptop and expensive on a desktop PC (500W+) so it's better to use a device that's cheap to build and replace and almost free to run. A Raspberry Pi is enough for light nodes while a full node will run fine on an ARM micro computer. Check out pre-synced pre-built devices by Block And Mortar , Ava.do , and DAppNode . Warning: never plug into your LAN anything you cannot thoroughly inspect and verify. You might be subjecting yourself to DNS hijacking or cryptojacking without knowing it. If the hardware and software aren't open source (at least the assembly part), they aren't safe to use.

The EVM - the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) running on each Ethereum node - is an emulation of a computer system. One example of a regular, non-blockchain virtual machine is the VirtualBox software, which allows you to emulate computer systems (guests) on your physical hardware (hosts). Any operation in the EVM consumes CPU cycles, disk access, memory, of the hosting machine (which carries a cost). This cost is paid via Ethereum 'gas'. In order to prevent \"overload\" of the host, each operation on the EVM consumes a certain amount of gas. Accessing memory or writing to disk have differing costs with each EVM operator setting an upper limit to the gas consumed during execution of a contract. So, if a malicious operator crafted a smart contract that went into an infinite loop, each loop would consume some gas and eventually run into the limit, at which point the EVM would abort the execution of this contract. Essentially, the larger, more complex the contract and the more operations it performs, the more expensive it is to run it. This process creates a fee market using gas prices where users decide how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas. Due to the gas block limit, the fee market almost always determines what order transactions are mined in because miners looking to profit will select the transactions with the highest fees. There are many key components to a transaction that are important to understand: Term Description Gas Unit for how much computation work is done. Gas Price How much you\u2019re willing to pay per gas for work (in gwei) Tx Cost Gas used * Gas Price Gas Limit Max gas you\u2019ll pay for a certain tx Gas Block Limit Max gas allowed in a block Fee Market Summary The Ethereum gas block limit means that there is a limit to how many computations can occur per block. This creates a fee market for gas where miners will accept higher paying transactions first. Users that want their transactions to be included first can pay a higher gas price than those who aren't in a rush. Key concepts to understand about the fee market are: Term Description Gas Price How much a user is willing to pay per gas for work (in gwei) Safe Low A price that will be mined in a reasonable time ( 50 blocks) Standard Gas Price The average gas price being paid by the network Fast Gas Price A price that will be mined within the next few blocks Signing Transactions on Ethereum Interacting with Smart Contracts via Etherscan and MetaMask Navigate to the Etherscan page for the Contract Address If the code and ABI have been uploaded to Etherscan, you should be able to access the 'Write Contract' tab Click the connect with MetaMask button Follow the documentation provided by the Contract's author to complete your transaction.

Running The first step in running an Ethereum node is synchronizing the Blockchian. There are a few options you can use to specify the sync mode of the geth client: --syncmode \"fast\" --syncmode \"full\" --syncmode \"light\" By default, geth will run in --syncmode \"fast\", this is the recommended option for running a complete Ethereum node. When using \"fast\" synchronization, the node will initially download blocks until it reaches the tip of the Blockchain without performing extensive validation steps. Once your node is in sync with the rest of the network, the node will validate transactions exactly like a full node. When using \"full\" synchronization, the node validates every transaction from downloaded blocks until it reaches the tip of the Blockchain. This is not advised, as it doesn't provide any benefits and can result in the node taking multiple days, or even weeks, to synchronize completely. Once the node is in sync, it will continue full validation of new transactions. When using \"light\" synchronization, the node only downloads a few recent block headers, making it a very quick sync. The drawback to this method is that the node is unable to perform reliable validation, as it doesn't have complete records of the Blockchain. If running on a device with low bandwidth or memory, the light node can be advantageous.

Requirements Full node: Multi-core CPU 4GB RAM SSD drive and at least 100GB free space A decent DSL connection is required Computers using HDD are advised to run a Light Node. Light node: Single-core CPU 512MB RAM 128MB free space on HDD Setup Download parity from the official Github releases page If on Linux, make the parity binary executable with chmod +x ./parity For running a compiled binary downloaded from the official Github releases page, no system dependencies are required. Running By default, the Parity client syncs the Ethereum Blockchain completely from a snapshot downloaded from peers and includes features such as auto-updating. To disable downloading a snapshot from peers, use --no-warp ; this saves a few GB of storage but takes longer to sync. If you wish to run a light node, simply specify the command line option --light to the program. Syncing can be faster by disregarding ancient blocks with --no-ancient-blocks ; costing only 20GB. The default sync with warp enabled occupies ~82GB of storage when completed (as of 15/10/2018).

# Store of Value

## What gives Ether value?

Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors.

Ether is primarily used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions. Most notably, ether’s functions include: used to pay ethereum transaction fees \(in the form of ‘gas’\) used to participate in ICOs \(or other crowdfunding mechanisms\) used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications \(MakerDAO, Compound\) can be lent or borrowed \(Dharma\) used to trade crypto-collectibles and other non-fungible tokens \(NFTs\) earned as a reward for completing bounties \(gitcoin\) accepted as payment at certain retailers

And soon, in Ethereum 2.0 \(Serenity\), users will be able to participate in securing the network by staking their ether and becoming a validator. The main tangible value add of a Proof of Stake system is that it locks a substantial amount of the supply of the underlying network asset. There are also discussions around introducing a ‘fee-burn’ model where a percentage of ether used to pay gas fees would be ‘burned’ in order to reduce the circulating supply of ether.

Of course, on top of all of this, we need to discuss ethers speculative value. This is value that is derived purely from speculative activities \(such as trading\) which currently accounts for most of the use of any crypto-network. As we saw in 2017, crypto-assets are a magnet for unbridled speculation \(with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months\). This speculative value isn’t particularly a bad thing — it brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals— but it is damaging to the short-term sentiment of all crypto-assets.

The above uses are unarguably functions of money. As you can see, ether is used as the native digital money of the Ethereum open economy and as that economy grows, so does the demand for ether.

## Can’t tokens on Ethereum be used instead of Ether?

Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The concept of using another asset to secure the Ethereum network is called ‘economic abstraction’ \(a good primer can be found [here](../../questions-about-ethereum/is-ether-needed-for-transaction-fees.md)\).

It is highly unlikely that the Ethereum protocol will ever implement economic abstraction as it lowers the security of the blockchain by compromising the value of ether.

## Why does Ether need to be valuable?

Like Bitcoin \(and most crypto-networks\) the value of the underlying asset is directly linked to how secure the particular network is. The more valuable the underlying asset, the higher the cost of attacking the network.

In Proof of Work systems, miners compete with each other to find a block and thus be rewarded for their work \(in the form of the native crypto-asset of the protocol\). As the price of the asset increases, it naturally brings with it more miners, which then increases the network difficulty. As the network difficulty increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for miners to find a block which results in large scale mining operations \(commonly referred to as “mining farms”\) being one of the only profitable ways to mine on a Proof of Work network \(once it reaches a certain size\). Miners can also join ‘mining pools’ in order to increase their chances of finding a block and thus increase their rewards.

It would currently cost an individual or group a large amount of money to successfully attack either the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains.

In Proof of Stake systems \(specifically Eth2.0\), users can stake 32 ether per validator and are rewarded for their work with additional ether at a sliding scale issuance rate.

Under Proof of Stake, the cost of attacking Ethereum will be directly tied to the cost of ether. The more validators participating in securing the network, the more coins an attacker would need to purchase in order to carry out an attack — this would quickly increase the price of ether and thus make it prohibitively more expensive for the attacker.

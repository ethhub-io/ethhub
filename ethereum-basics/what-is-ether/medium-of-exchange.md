# Medium of Exchange

Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum economy \(for a wide range of apps\), a unit of account for various parties \(the most obvious being companies that have raised ether via ICOs\), has historically been a decent store of value as ether’s price has appreciated over 25,000% \(from $0.30 to $85.00\) since its ICO, has had a somewhat predictable supply schedule and ether has grown substantially in usage since its inception.

An object \(physical or digital\) that is considered money also needs to have five distinct attributes: fungibility, durability, portability, divisibility and established history \(lindy effect\).

Ether is highly portable \(because it’s digital\), durable \(again, because it’s digital\), divisible \(up to 8 decimal places\) and fungible \(ether isn’t really fungible since accounts can be blacklisted quite easily\).

While the Ethereum network is only 3 and a half years old, it continues to build a strong established history. The Ethereum network \(and ether\) have \(so far\) survived The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets \(including a current 94% drop in price\).

On top of this, ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permissionless, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks.

The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties \(especially those in the Bitcoin community\) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply \(like Bitcoin\) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate \(like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0\).

There is currently no concrete answer to which approach is better. A capped supply suffers from the fact that once the protocol stops issuing new coins in the form of block rewards, it’s up to users paying a sufficient amount of network fees to incentivize miners to secure the network. Whereas, in Ethereum 2.0, while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it dilutes the value of ether for those that are not validators \(if the Ethereum economy does not grow more than the issuance rate\).

# Network Usage

Ether is required to transact on the Ethereum network.

As explained in the [gas section](https://docs.ethhub.io/-LTo-PwFj1VwulVCZAFW/~/drafts/-LUpsUsOLWLhW7Fftje4/primary/using-ethereum/ethereum-network-basics/transactions/gas), every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is a unit used to measure the computational power required to process the transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners expect to be compensated. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei \(1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei\). 

For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH.

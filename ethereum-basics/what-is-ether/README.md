# What is Ether?

## Summary

Ether (ETH or Îž) is the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network and is used to compensate miners who secure transactions. A planned upgrade to the Ethereum protocol in 2019-2021 would replace mining with a less computationally expensive Proof of Stake mechanism which will be secured by validators, who are also expected to receive a proportional compensation in Ether. Ether also has many current use cases, such as a store of value \(e.g. in lending collateral\), a medium of exchange \(e.g. in trade and payments\), and a unit of account \(e.g. in digital marketplaces\).

# The Stable Fund

The Stable Fund is an investment fund started by L4, in partnership with MakerDAO. We help startups using the Dai Stablecoin System with business development, financing, and strategic introductions.

## Investment 

We offer equity free grants (up to $25k) to alpha projects and equity funding up to $200k for projects further ahead. We'll also provide introductions and prepare projects to pitch to the top Silicon Valley and crypto investors for larger amounts.

## What we look for

1. Companies with a strong technical founder
2. Companies with just an idea to companies scaling
3. Companies using Dai or Maker Infrastructure as a core component
4. Companies that are feasible with current state of blockchain technology

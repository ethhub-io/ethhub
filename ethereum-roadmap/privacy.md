# Privacy

## Summary

Privacy on Ethereum is being actively worked on by a number of different teams. 

### There are a couple of key technologies to know about:

* Zero Knowledge-based
  * zk-SNARKs (used in Zcash) 
  * zk-STARKs

[Aztec Protocol](../built-on-ethereum/infrastructure/aztec-protocol.md) is building an efficient zero-knowledge privacy protocol and decentralised exchange. The protocol is already live on Ethereums mainnet.

[Starkware Industries](https://www.starkware.co/) is using STARK technology to improve scalability and privacy on Ethereum.

[Enigma Protocol](https://blog.enigma.co/welcome-to-enigma-start-here-e65c8c9125ef) are building ['secret contracts'](https://blog.enigma.co/defining-secret-contracts-f40ddee67ef2) which enable [computation over encrypted data](https://blog.enigma.co/computing-over-encrypted-data-d36621458447).

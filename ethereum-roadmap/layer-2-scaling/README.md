Layer 2 scaling solutions are those that are not implemented at the base layer. They are often explained as being "on top of" or "to the side" of the base \(layer 1\) chain. The core solutions being worked on for Ethereum layer 2 scaling are:

* [Plasma](plasma.md)
* [State Channels](state-channels.md)
* [Payment Channels](payment-channels.md)
* [ZK-STARKs](zk-starks.md)

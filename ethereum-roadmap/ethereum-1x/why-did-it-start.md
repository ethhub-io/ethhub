# Why did it start?
Group of Ethereum core developers and friends talked at Devcon IV and realised that they all share similar view - that Ethereum mainnet, if left unchanged, would become very hard or impossible to use due to severe performance degradation, and increased storage requirements.
Performance degradation mostly due to the large (and increasing) state
Increased storage requirements mostly due to keeping blocks, event logs (receipts), and state history (currently prunable in major clients).

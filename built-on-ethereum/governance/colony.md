# Colony

## What is Colony?

Colony is infrastructure for the future of work: self-organizing companies that run via software, not paperwork. It could be a community project, a company, or a non-profit â€” your imagination is the only limit.

## How does it work?

Every colony has its own token. You earn tokens by doing work. The more tokens you hold, the more of the colony you own. Tokens let you stake your ownership on your good judgement when proposing tasks, or claiming someone should be paid.

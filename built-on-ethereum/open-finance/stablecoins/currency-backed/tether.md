## Controversy

A blockchain critic has raised questions about the relationship between Bitfinex and Tether, accusing Bitfinex of creating "magic Tethers out of thin air". In September 2017, Tether published a [memorandum](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf) from a public accounting firm that Tether Limited then said showed that tethers were fully backed by US dollars; however, according to the New York Times, independent attorney Lewis Cohen [stated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html) the document, because of the careful way it was phrased, does not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars". The documents also fail to ascertain whether the balances in question are otherwise encumbered.". The accounting firm specifically stated that this information is intended solely to assist the management of Tether Limited ... and is not intended to be, and should not be, used or relied upon by any other party.

During the course of a price manipulation investigation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United States Department of Justice, Phil Potter, Chief Strategy Officer of Bitfinex and an executive of Tether Limited, departed Bitfinex in 2018. The investigation was continuing on November 20, 2018 and focusing on Tether and Bitfinex, according to Bloomberg.

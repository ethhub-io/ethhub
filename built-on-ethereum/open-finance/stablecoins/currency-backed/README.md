## Currency-backed Stablecoins

Cryptocurrencies backed by currency (fiat) are the most common and were the first type of stablecoins on the market. Their characteristics are:

* Their value is pegged to one or more currencies (most commonly the US dollar, also the Euro and the Swiss franc).

* The tether is realized off-chain, through banks or other types of regulated financial institutions which serve as depositaries of the currency used to back the stablecoin.

* The amount of the currency used for backing of the stablecoin has to reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin.

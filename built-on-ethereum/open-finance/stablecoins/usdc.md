### What is USDC?

USD Coin (USDC) is an currency-backed stablecoin created by Centre which was founded by Circle and Coinbase. The initial implementation is an ERC-20 token that creates  possibilities in payments, lending, investing, trading and trade finance. Individuals and institutions can deposit US dollars from bank accounts, convert those dollars into tokens usable everywhere the internet reaches (subject to the token’s compliance controls), and redeem USDC tokens and cash out to bank accounts.

USD Coin is supported by many wallets, exchanges and software applications.

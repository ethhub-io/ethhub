# Polymath

## Description

Polymath aims to bring compliant securities to Ethereum in the form of tokens.

Any company can apply to issue tokenized securities using Polymaths platform. Legal delegates review the application, place their bids and then an issuer selects a delegate based on the bid and their past performance. The issuer publishes all required documentation, with the hash of the documents placed on-chain. In collaboration with the chosen legal delegate, they define a set of restrictions to comply with regulators.

Investors can purchase tokenized securities from issuers as long as they fit the compliance criteria. They will need to work with one of the KYC providers to bind their identity with their Ethereum address. Once they are approved, they can trade security tokens on primary and secondary markets.

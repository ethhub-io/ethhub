# Abacus

## Summary

Abacus makes an ecosystem for financial applications and service providers.

Users can interact with financial applications using Abacus. Under the hood, these applications communicate with smart contracts and service providers.

Service providers can be used for identity, compliance, and appraisal. They can run either on-hain or off-chain. In case the service is running off-chain, users should first request a quote for the service. After the user submits the data and pays for the service, a provider will write results in the blockchain, where applications and the protocol can access it.

# 8x

## Summary

8x defines a protocol for recurring payments. It allows creating subscriptions for companies and paying them for users. Any ERC-20 token can be used for payment, though a stablecoin like DAI might be more convenient for both parties. For the end user, the protocol allows _pulling_ payments instead of _pushing_ them, which results in less cognitive costs and decreased churn.

Companies create a subscription by defining a token address, amount, period, and fee in a smart contract. This fee will be paid to one of the service nodes to regularly execute payment transactions. The company can then share this contract with its customers.

Once a customer opts into a subscription, a service node can trigger payments from the customer to the company once per pay period. Nodes who hold more 8x tokens will have a priority in processing transactions and therefore will earn more fees. Service nodes also need to stake tokens. Staked tokens will be slashed if the node fails to process the transaction.

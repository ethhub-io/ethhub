# Etherisc

Etherisc is a protocol to collectively build insurance products. Common infrastructure, product templates and insurance license-as-a-service make a platform that allows anyone to create their own insurance products.

## DIP Token

DIP Tokens act as the native internal currency that is inseparable from the protocol and network of its users. DIP tokens are needed to earn transaction fees \(% of insurance premiums or fixed cost\), incentivize and reward platform users to bring risk to the network, build and maintain risk transfer products. The total supply of Etherisc Tokens is 1 Billion.

DIP tokens give users access to the Decentralized Insurance Platform. By staking DIP token, participants provide collateral \(bond\) to guarantee future performance, availability, and service levels. Staking also signals quality and reputation. As a result, participants can earn money monetizing their skills, software \(for example risk models or UI/UX\), risk capital, insurance licenses, claim processing, or regulatory compliance/reporting services.

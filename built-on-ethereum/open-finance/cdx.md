# CDx

## Description

CDx is a protocol for default credit swaps. Default credit swaps is a financial product used as a protection from the default of another party. Swap buyer makes a series of payments during the insurance period. In case of default, a buyer receives compensation.

CDx implements swap creation via minting tokens unique to each type of the swap. Sellers specify insurance amount and their premium. A buyer then discovers these offers and decide whether they want to purchase a swap. Offers are distributed via relayers with the on-chain settlement.

Swaps can be traded on the secondary market as any other token. In the event of default, a current owner of swap tokens can exchange them into compensation defined at swap creation.

# KyberSwap

## Description

KyberSwap is decentralized exchange that uses an on-chain matching system to instantly convert tokens into other tokens.

## Kyber Network

KyberSwap is built on the Kyber Network.

Kyber Network builds a liquidity pool of tokens to facilitate token swaps. Different parties, including Kyber itself, maintain their own pools called reserves.

Each reserve is a smart contract that is controlled by reserve admin who deployed it. Reserves vary in supported tokens, liquidity and conversion prices. When a user wants to exchange one token for another, Kyber scans all reserves to pick the cheapest one.

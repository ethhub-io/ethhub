# Republic Protocol

## Description

The goal of Republic Protocol is to provide an ability for traders to execute their orders privately. The protocol defines a way to create a dark pool of orders where they can be matched with each other without revealing any information about them.

In Republic Protocol, orders are split into fragments, which are then sent to the different nodes in the network. To reveal an order, the user needs to collect a majority of fragments. Honest traders distribute fragments uniformly across the network, so if an attacker wants to collect a majority of fragments, they will need to control the majority of nodes.

Nodes are controlled by dark pool operators. They stake tokens to be eligible to receive order fragments, and the stake is proportional to the number of fragments they are able to receive. Operators match orders in collaboration with each other in a trustless way.

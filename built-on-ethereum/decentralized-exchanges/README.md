# Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Decentralized Exchanges (sometimes referred to as 'non-custodial exchanges') allow for the trading of crypto assets without the need for a trusted central authority. This cuts down on the risk of exchange hacks and many other risks. There are many types of decentralized exchanges and it's important to understand the differences.

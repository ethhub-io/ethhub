# Off-Chain Orderbook, On-Chain Settlement

For "Off-Chain Orderbook, On-Chain Settlement" decentralized exchanges, final trades occur on chain but every order is hosted by a third party called a Relayer. This was the style of many early generation decentralized exchanges built on Ethereum.

## Exchanges

* [0x Protocol](0x-protocol/)
* [Loopring](https://github.com/econoar/ethhub/tree/81bd0e6af7d95334c8b24e74b3dbbe52f13bca2b/built-on-ethereum/decentralized-exchanges/off-chain-orderbook-on-chain-settlement/loopring.md)
* [IDEX](idex.md)
* [Hydro](hydro.md)

## Pros

* Faster order management than On-Chain solutions
* Less fees involved than On-Chain solutions

## Cons

* No full guarantee that a maker order is still active
* The relayer could front run an order

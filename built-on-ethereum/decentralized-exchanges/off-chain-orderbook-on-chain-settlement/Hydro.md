# Hydro

## Description

The DDEX team forked 0x and called their new protocol Hydro. They iterating different parts of the 0x protocol, but the most important seem to be a new matching engine and a new liquidity sharing model. Unlike 0x, there is no requirement that one pay trading fees with an appcoin.

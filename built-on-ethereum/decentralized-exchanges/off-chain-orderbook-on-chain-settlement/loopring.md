# Loopring

## Description

Loopring aims to implement a decentralized exchange protocol with a hybrid order model with a focus on liquidity. Loopring introduces two novel tools that can increase liquidity: order ring and consortium blockchain.

Order ring is a method of chaining multiple orders that execute each other. Itâ€™s up to relayers and arbitragers to find rings and execute them. On the protocol level, Loopring equally distributes margins between orders and prevents rent-seeking by adding redundant orders to the ring.

Relayers can cooperate by sharing liquidity. Loopring offers a way to do that by creating a consortium blockchain. This blockchain is fast \(1-2 second block time\) and supports history pruning. Relayers decide whether they want to join the consortium, make their own pool, or not to share liquidity at all.

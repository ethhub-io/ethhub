# Prediction Markets

## Summary

Prediction markets facilitate the trading of event derivatives. They have been around since the 1990s and are sometimes also referred to as information markets, idea futures, and decision markets. Participants use prediction markets to speculate on outcomes of events. Many believe that decentralizing prediction markets will allow us to harness their full potential by lowering the cost of participating, bypassing strict regulation and increasing adoption by making the platforms more accessible across geographies.

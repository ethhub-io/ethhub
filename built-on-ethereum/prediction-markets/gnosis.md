Gnosis creates a global forecasting and information discovery tool by building a prediction market platform on Ethereum. This platform strives to gather liquidity of expert information.

Gnosis starts with a core layer, which is a set of smart contracts. Value-added paid services built by the team will form the Gnosis Service layer. Gnosis also plans to make end-user applications along with third-party developers at the spplication layer.

## Token

There are two tokens in Gnosis: GNO and OWL. The main utility of OWL token is to pay for the creation of prediction markets. Users receive OWL by locking their GNO tokens. The used OWL is burned.

## Gnosis Safe

On November 28th, 2018, the Gnosis Safe smart contract went live on the Ethereum mainnet. The Gnosis Safe allows you to download the Android app (iOS coming soon) and deploy a mobile-friendly personal smart contract wallet (multisig). You can add a Chrome extension that will hold the second key and will allow you to interact with dApps similar to Metamask (but then with your phone effectively as a 2FA device).

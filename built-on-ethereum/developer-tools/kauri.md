# Kauri

## Description

Kauri is a decentralized knowledge base, blogging platform and is building infrastructure for gathering technical information about Ethereum.

The aim of the project is to create a network of writers, editors, and curators that collectively contribute to the growing set of articles and tutorials. Thanks to Ethereum and IPFS, authors have full ownership of their work.

Kauri is starting as a place for the technical documentation for various blockchain protocols and applications, as well as building for Ethereum in general. The team wants to acquire developers of these projects as moderators and active content creators.

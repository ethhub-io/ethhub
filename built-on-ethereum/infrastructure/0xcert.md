# 0xcert

## Description

0xcert is a protocol for attesting and validating issuers of non-fungible tokens.

There are many different protocols, applications, and companies trying to bring real-world assets and certifications to the blockchain. Yet, there is no clear consensus on how to validate the legitimacy of the minted tokens. For example, thereâ€™s no way to ensure that the issuer has a right to mint identity tokens on Ethereum. As public blockchains are permissionless, anyone can create such tokens, yet only tokens created by a legit identity provider will be valuable.

0xcert creates a standard for certified non-fungible tokens, Xcerts. Developers can interact with this standard via an SDK and high-level APIs. Additionally, 0xcert is going to create a decentralized registry of authentic issuers.

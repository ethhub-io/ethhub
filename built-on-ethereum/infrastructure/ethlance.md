# Ethlance

## Description

Ethlance is a freelance platform.

The listings include required skills, pricing, and the description of what needs to be done. Payments are made in ether. Ethlance doesn’t hold any funds, as all payments are peer to peer and feeless. All listings are stored on Ethereum and IPFS, thus anyone can access them.

Ethlance also supports job sponsorships. If the creator opted into sponsorship during listing creation, anyone will be able to chip in to pay for it. Collected funds will be used to pay the freelancer who will complete the task and unused funds are returned to contributors. Therefore, it’s possible to crowdfund “public good” tasks.

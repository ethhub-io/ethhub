# Aragon

## Description

Aragon is a platform for creating and running decentralized organizations.

Aragon Core is a collection of primitives designed to cover all essential functions of any organization. It handles identity, permissions, reputation, ownership, capital, rewards, and more.

Aragon Network acts as a digital jurisdiction that creates a place for decentralized organizations to operate. Economically, the network accumulates capital in the form of fees and spends it to reward various service providers that help Aragon to operate. Examples of such providers include protocol development, decentralized court, and contract upgradeability.

Governance is operated by token holders. Changes of the protocol will be offered in the form of proposals. Holders vote for proposals by staking the tokens. Examples of proposals include regulating ANT issuance, fund allocation, and network rules.

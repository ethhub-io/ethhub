# ERC Standards

ERCs \(Ethereum Request for Comments\) are technical documents used by smart contract developers at Ethereum. They define a set of rules required to implement tokens for the Ethereum ecosystem. These documents are usually created by developers, and they include information about protocol specifications and contract descriptions. Before becoming an standard, an ERC must be revised, commented and accepted by the community through an EIP \(Ethereum Improvement Proposal\).

# ERC-777 - Advanced Token Standard

## Summary

ERC777 defines all the functions required to send tokens on behalf of another address, contract or regular account. For this purpose, it uses the ERC820 standard. The use of ER820 enables the registration of metadata in smart contracts in order to allow backwards compatibility with previous versions of token implementations. ERC777 includes functions for authorization, revocation, transfer and checks.

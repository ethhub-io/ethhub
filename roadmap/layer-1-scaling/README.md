# Layer 1 Scaling

Scaling is one of the most important concepts when it comes to the future of blockchains. Currently, Ethereum can process a limited amount of transactions a day due to the gas block limit. All blockchains deal with the scalability trilemma, first described by Vitalik Buterin. The trilemma states that blockchains can only have two of the three following properties: 

* **Decentralization:** defined as the system being able to run in a scenario where each participant only has access to O\(c\) resources, ie. a regular laptop or small VPS
* **Scalability:** defined as being able to process O\(n\) &gt; O\(c\) transactions
* **Security:** defined as being secure against attackers with up to O\(n\) resources

Ethereum prioritizes decentralization and security over scalability. However, many ideas are being worked on to improve scalability without sacrificing decentralization and security.

Ethereum's scaling solutions have been broken into two main components:

* [Layer 1](sharding/): scaling solutions implemented on the base-level protocol
* [Layer 2](layer-2/): scaling solutions built on top of the base-level protocol.

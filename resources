Ethereum Myths
    Is Ethereum more expensive to use when the Ether price is higher?
    I heard that Ethereum will never scale so how will it support all these dapps?
    Is Ethereum centralized?
    If Ethereum is not free to use how will it ever compete with blockchains that provide free transactions?
    Is Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum?
    Did Ethereum reverse a transaction and perform a bailout?
    Is Ethereum a Store of Value?
    If Ether has an infinite supply how can we expect Ether to ever hold value?
    Is Ethereum a security?
    Is Ethereum only good for scam ICOs?

# Development

## Summary

Ethereum is a blockchain, first-and-foremost. Its primary artifact is the smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, a language with syntax similar to JavaScript. Currently Vyper is being developed to offer another choice when developing smart contracts, with syntax similar to Python.

### Languages

Solidity - Most commonly used language.

- [Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity)
- [Community Audited Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) by OpenZeppelin

Vyper - Newer language focused on security and auditability.

## About

OneClickDapp instantly builds you a dApp with a simple URL to bookmark or share with a friend. Anyone with the dApp URL can interact with your shiny new smart contract, and access all functions at the correct address/network. Don't write a single line of front-end code. Forget about verifying your contract on Etherscan or MEW.

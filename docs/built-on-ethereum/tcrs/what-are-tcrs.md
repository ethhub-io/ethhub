# Token Curated Registries \(TCRs\)

## Summary

Token Curated Registries \(TCRs\) are registries of listings generated by token holders. Listings can be anything from names to hashes of full-blown records stored in IPFS. A holder stakes a portion of tokens to perform an action, i.e. adding a listing. Token holders can vote on whether to accept or reject the action using their tokens. A majority wins the vote and the action is accepted or rejected. The list is updated and should become more valuable given the improved listings and the fact that the staked tokens are now out of circulation.

Token holders, acting in their own self-interest, will produce a valuable list by obtaining and staking a finite supply token. The more listings staked, the scarcer the tokens; the more valuable the list, the more valuable the tokens.

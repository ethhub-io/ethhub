# Bloom

## Summary

Bloom is a set of products designed to facilitate lending and borrowing on a global scale. Credit products are unavailable for many people, and those who have access to it have their credit data siloed, which makes it less useful.

The idea behind Bloom is to make credit data global and interoperable, and loans â€” available to everyone. Not only users can share their reputation across countries and banks, but they can also share their creditworthiness with peers.

The protocol consists of three components: ID, IQ, and Score. BloomID is an identity attestation protocol. BloomIQ is a registry of given loans. BloomScore is a credit scoring system.

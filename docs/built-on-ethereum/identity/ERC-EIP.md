# ERC-EIP

There are a number of identity related Ethereum standards under development, in addition to [ERC725 and 735](ERC725), :

* [ERC: Lightweight Identity #1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) —This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ERC1056 ❤ ERC780 — an open identity and claims protocol for Ethereum](https://medium.com/uport/erc1056-erc780-an-open-identity-and-claims-protocol-for-ethereum-aef7207bc744)
* [EIP-780 Ethereum Claims Registry](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/f29527ab39357548b06b29e937a48f06ae099de7/EIPS/eip-712.md) - This is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data
* [ERC-1484 Digital Identity Aggregator](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) —A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [EIP-1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md) - 
This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesn’t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases. 
* [ERC-1077 and ERC-1078: The magic of executable signed messages](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-1077-and-erc-1078-the-magic-of-executable-signed-messages-to-login-and-do-actions/351)

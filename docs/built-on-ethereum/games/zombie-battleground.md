# Zombie Battleground

## Summary

Zombie Battleground is a Magic: The Gathering-style collectible card game that stores all of your game assets and data on its own dedicated Plasma DAppChain.

Since the cards are stored on the Blockchain as non-fungible \(ERC721\) tokens, not only can a player prove that they own their cards — they can even sell or trade them with anyone for actual money.

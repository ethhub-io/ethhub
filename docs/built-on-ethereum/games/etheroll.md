# Etheroll

## Summary

Etheroll is an Ethereum smart contract for placing bets on our provably-fair dice game using Ether with no deposits or sign-ups. Each dice roll is provably random and cryptographically secure thanks to the nature of the Ethereum blockchain.

## History

Etheroll's inital crowdsale was refunded after The DAO was hacked in June 2016. The sale raised 2,326 ETH in the five days it ran before the team decided it was best to trigger the refund. The team reached this decision in an effort to ensure the integity of their smart contracts. The crowdsale would continue as planned in March 2017.

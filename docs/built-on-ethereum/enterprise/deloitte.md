## Summary
Deloitte has a dedicated team (EMEA blockchain lab) exploring blockchain capabilities. Recently it partenered with Institute of Banking (IoB), Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank to develop an Ethereum-based tool which facilitate wide range of staff-related data management processes. It is currently in beta test mode and a full rollout can be expected by summer 2020.

The new platform is a first in the European financial services industry and will support the verification, tracking, direct access to, and management of, regulatory and other professional designations, education qualifications and lifelong learning credentials.

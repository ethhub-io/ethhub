# Aragon
Create and manage DAOs. 

## What is Aragon?

Aragon is a project that aims to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizational structures by using blockchain technology. The project aims to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. Aragon provides the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives.

By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, Aragon enables a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value.

Aragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship.

The Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isnâ€™t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country.

The Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future.

## How it works

Aragon is most powerful and modular way to build and run DAOs. Use aragonOS, AragonJS and AragonUI.

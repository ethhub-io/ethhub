# 0x Protocol

## Summary

0x is an open protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer exchange of digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. 0x is open source, free to use, and provides a drop-in exchange solution for developers to build on top of. Developers use 0x protocol to build decentralized exchanges \(DEXs\), marketplaces for digital collectibles, and to integrate exchange functionality into wallets.

## 0x protocol overview

In 0x Protocol, orders are transported off-chain over any arbitrary medium, massively reducing gas costs and reducing blockchain bloat. Relayers help broadcast orders and collect a fee each time they facilitate a trade. Anyone can build a relayer.

The simplest example of a Relayer is a website allowing users to create, discover and fill orders. The Relayer must build out a UI and host a backend database to provide this functionality.

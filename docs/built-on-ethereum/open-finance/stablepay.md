# StablePay

## Summary

> StablePay is a decentralized payment platform that enables users to make payments with Ether or any ERC20 tokens that get instantly converted to any token of the receiverâ€™s choosing.

## How StablePay Works
The contracts function as a gateway for receiving token payments, seek the best rate for trading on existing decentralized exchanges and swap the tokens into DAI to finally send them over to the receiver.

# Zerion

## Summary

Zerion is building a trustless bank for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on top of [MakerDAO](/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/stablecoins/dai/), [Uniswap](/built-on-ethereum/decentralized-exchanges/pool-based/uniswap/), [Compound](/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/lending/compound/), [Dharma](/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/lending/dharma/), [Set](/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/set-protocol/), [DyDx](/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/lending/dydx/) and others. Zerion aims at transforming the decentralized finance experience to drive the next wave of adoption of blockchain-based finance. You can think of it as Chase for the decentralized economy. Instead of relying on a third party to manage their assets (such as through traditional banking and existing FinTech), Zerion users keep full control over their assets and execute common banking services with minimal fees.

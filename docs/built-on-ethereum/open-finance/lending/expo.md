# expo

## Summary

Expo is built on the dYdX Protocol, and is the easiest way to buy and sell dYdX Margin Tokens. Expo supports tokens such as Short Ethereum ‘sETH’, an ERC-20 token pegged to a short ETH position, and will add support for additional short and leveraged assets in the future.

## How expo works

Expo integrates with the dYdX Margin Trading Protocol, and allows users to buy, sell, and manage Margin Tokens. The mechanics of the protocol \(obtaining a loan, spot trading\) are abstracted away from the trader, significantly simplifying the margin trading experience.

### Expo automatically:

* Sources lending liquidity in the underlying asset from various dYdX lending partners
* Sources spot liquidity from decentralized exchanges
* Locks collateral into the position
* Mints new short or leveraged tokens to give the user margin exposure
* All users need to do is decide how much to buy.

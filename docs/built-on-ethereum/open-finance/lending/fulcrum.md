# Fulcrum

## Summary

Fulcrum is the most simple and powerful way to lend and margin trade. It is the first and only completely trustless platform for margin; it does not use centralized price feeds or centrally administered margin calls. It is permissionless and rent free; there are no fees and no accounts. Fulcrum is built on the [bZx base protocol](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/open-finance/lending/bzx/) and extends the protocol by allowing both loans and margin positions to be tokenized. The bZx base protocol was successfully [audited by ZK Labs](https://github.com/mattdf/audits/blob/master/bZx/bzx-audit.pdf).

## Collateral Types

DAI, ETH, WBTC, LINK, ZRX, REP and KNC tokens could be used as collateral.

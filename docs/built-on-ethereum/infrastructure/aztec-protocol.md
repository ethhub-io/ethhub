# Aztec Protocol

The AZTEC protocol is a second-layer solutions that uses zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions to enable confidential transactions for any generic digital asset on Ethereum, including existing assets. The AZTEC protocol supports a stealth address protocol that can be used to obfuscate the link between a note 'owner' and any on-chain identity. The first contract built for the Aztec Protocol is for MakerDao's DAI token.

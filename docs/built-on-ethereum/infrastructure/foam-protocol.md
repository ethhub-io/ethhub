# FOAM Protocol

## Summary

FOAM is an open protocol for decentralized, geospatial data markets. The protocol is designed to empower users to build a consensus-driven map of the world that can be trusted for every application. As technology evolves and changes, maps need to change too. FOAM secures physical space on the blockchain, harnessing the power of Ethereum with a cryptographic software utility token used to provide computational work and verification to the network.

The component elements of the FOAM protocol are designed to provide spatial protocols, standards and applications that bring geospatial data to blockchains and empower a consensus-driven map of the world. Token mechanisms and cryptoeconomics underpin the elements of FOAM and empower the distributed users to coordinate and interact in a decentralized and permissionless fashion.

# Decentralized Exchanges

## Summary

Decentralized Exchanges \(sometimes referred to as 'non-custodial exchanges'\) allow for the trading of crypto assets without the need for a trusted central authority. This cuts down on the risk of exchange hacks and many other risks. There are many types of decentralized exchanges and it's important to understand the differences.

### Different types of DEXs:

* [Off-chain order book](off-chain-orderbook/)
* [Peer-to-peer](peer-to-peer/)

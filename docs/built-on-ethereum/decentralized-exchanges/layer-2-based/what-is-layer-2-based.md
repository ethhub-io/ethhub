description: A dive into what layer 2 based decentralized exchanges on Ethereum are and the different options.

# Layer 2 Based

Layer 2 decentralized exchanges are built on layer 2 scaling methods, bringing much of the benefits regarding saving on on-chain transaction gas fees, settlement speed, and scalability. but also inheriting the potential underlying weaknesses.

## Exchanges

* [TEX](tex.md)

### Pros

* Faster order management than on-chain solutions
* Less fees involved than on-chain solutions
* Same scalability as centralized exchanges

### Cons

* Inherit the potential weaknesses of the underlying layer 2 solutions

# Decentraland

## Description

Decentraland is an open virtual world that players can modify and interact with.

Decentraland is a marketplace for buying and selling digital assets representing pieces of land in the virtual world. Initially, the land is distributed via an auction and the winning bidder receives the ownership of a land. They can then trade it on a secondary market.

Each land has a 'scene' where an owner can put 3D objects and code their interactions. Therefore, it’s possible to create games and attractions within Decentraland.

The world will be accessible via a VR browser on multiple platforms.

# Multi-signature wallets
## A multi-signature wallet is like...

* a bank vault that requires each bank manager's password to open.

* a planning committee where every expense needs to be signed off on by each member of the committee.

* in a video game lobby where each player needs to approve of each action like readying up to start the game, kicking a teammate, etc. No one player alone can perform these actions.

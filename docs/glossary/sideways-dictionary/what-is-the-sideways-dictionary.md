# Sideways Dictionary

Taking a page from [The Sideways Dictionary](https://sidewaysdictionary.com/#/about), this sideways dictionary provides analogies instead of definitions for key terms and concepts of the Ethereum ecosystem.

This section of EthHub is intended to be a resource for anyone who is still struggling with grasping a concept. Sometimes a definition doesn't quite click in your head. We hope this collection of analogies and explanations can be used as a shared resource for all members of the Ethereum community, newcomers and oldtimers alike.

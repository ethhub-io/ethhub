# Welcome to EthHub

The goal of EthHub is to provide a single source for essential Ethereum information. We attempt to accomplish this goal through three main areas:

1. [EthHub Docs](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/what-is-ethereum/)
2. [Into the Ether Podcast](https://podcast.ethhub.io)
3. [EthHub Weekly Newsletter](https://ethhub.substack.com)

The Docs section, where you are now, is the core of EthHub. This documentation is open source and hosted on GitHub which means that anyone has the ability to contribute. The goal is to make sure the information is available, clear, concise, and up to date.

## How to make changes to EthHub pages

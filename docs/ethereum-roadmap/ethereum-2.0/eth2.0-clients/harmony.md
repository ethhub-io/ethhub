# Harmony

## Background

Harmony is ethereum’s original Java client formerly maintained by a group of independent developers.

## Implementation Details

Harmony is building an Ethereum 2.0 client written in the Java programming language and acts as an alternative to the enterprise-focused Pantheon client.

Harmony operates under a General Public License \(GPL\) designed to ensure any implementations of the code remain "free software and stay free software".

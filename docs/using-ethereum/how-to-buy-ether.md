# How to Buy Ether

In order to [interact](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/) with the Ethereum network, you will need to own ether (ETH). Unless you are mining, the only way to acquire ETH is from someone that already owns it. Below is a list of reputable online crypto exchanges where you can acquire ETH with fiat or other crypto.

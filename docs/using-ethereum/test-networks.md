# Test Networks

## Görli

### Summary

The Görli (also spelled "Goerli") test network is the primary testnet for Ethereum. To acquire testETH on Görli, anyone can get it from a faucet (see below). Since the Ethereum merge (fall 2022), all other testnets including Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Kovan, have been deprecated. This means that Goerli is the only testnet that developers should use.

# Py-EVM (Trinity)

## Summary

Py-EVM is a new implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\) written in Python. Trinity is the client software that connects to the Ethereum network and runs on top of Py-EVM. It is currently in active development but is quickly progressing through the test suite provided by ethereum/tests. Trinity and Py-EVM aim to replace existing Python Ethereum implementations to eventually become the defacto standard for the Python ecosystem.

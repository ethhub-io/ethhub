# Gitcoin Torch


## Summary

The [Gitcoin Torch](https://medium.com/gitcoin/the-gitcoin-torch-2baad180cc14) is a community effort to spur funding of Ethereum projects using the [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) platform. 

## What are you talking about?

The [Gitcoin CLR Matching](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-grants-50k-open-source-fund-e20e09dc2110) effort contains of two main components, matchers and donators. 

**Matchers** are individuals who have pledged a certain amount of Dai to a matching pool. These funds will be used to match any donations from individuals to a Grant.

**Donators** are individuals who want to direct their own funds towards certain projects. These funds will be matched at the end of the effort using [CLR matching](https://medium.com/gitcoin/experiments-with-liberal-radicalism-ad68e02efd4).

## OK great! How do I participate?

Those who want to act as **matchers** should reach out to @econoar on Twitter. Matchers are able to hold their own funds until the end to disperse or can send to an address that acts as a treasury until the end.

Those who want to act as **donators** can head over to Gitcoin Grants and give to their favorite projects funds.

## Why would I participate?

All projects on Gitcoin Grants are open source. This is a great way to give to teams who are building open source projects that are vital to the future success of Ethereum. Also, it's a great opportunity to make your single donation go further with matching contributions behind it.

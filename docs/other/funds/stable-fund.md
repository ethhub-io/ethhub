# Stable Fund

The Stable Fund is a small to mid-size granting program run by MakerDAO. It is designed to incentivise the third-party Dai ecosystem by disbursing milestone-based grants to teams wishing to build on our financial primitives.

## Investment

We offer equity free grants of up to $50k.

## What we look for

Projects that:

* use Dai or MakerDao infrastructure as a core component
* increase Dai adoption
* add stability to and/or de-risk existing economies
* open up new markets
* provide novel, easy to use, solutions
* solve _real_ problems

# ERC721x

ERC721x is an extension of [ERC721](https://github.com/econoar/ethhub/tree/5b2440487681e9725c67cfc2350811a3a12e58bc/tokens/what-is-erc/tokens/what-is-erc/erc721.md) that adds support for multi-fungible tokens and batch transfers, while being fully backward-compatible.

ERC721x is heavily inspired by the [ERC1178](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1178/) token standard.

# ERC1257 Proof Of Payment standard

## Summary
Proof of Payment (POP) is an event (evm log) that provide a record of successful payment. Either via Ether or ERC20 token.

## Motivation for token standard
With the introduction of this standard, the need for multiple deposit addresses is removed, while facilitating the recording of decentralized token payments from both humans and smart contracts. Currently for merchants, simply tracking the amount and transaction hash may not be sufficient. For example, a payment may have to reflect the order ID as well. To tackle this problem, one popular method used by merchants is to open unique deposit addresses where one order ID corresponds to one deposit address.

Unfortunately, this method of utilizing multiple deposit addresses for ETH and ERC20 token payments becomes a hassle due to gas issues, where the merchant needs to pay gas for

  1. Sending ETH to these deposit addresses which will be used to pay for gas for step 2
  2. Making an ETH / ERC20 token transfer to a consolidated wallet address once payment is made

Therefore there is a need for a more systematic way to include order information with ETH and ERC20 token payments in addition to logging and recording them so that it does not require multiple deposit addresses to be used.
